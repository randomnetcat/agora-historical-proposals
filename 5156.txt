Amend rule 869 to read

      Citizenship is an entity switch with values Null (default) and
      Registered, tracked by the registrar.  A player is an entity
      whose citizenship is Registered.

      The verb "to be registered" means to become a player (i.e., to
      have one's citizenship changed from Null to Registered), and the
      verb "to be deregistered" means to cease to be a player (i.e.,
      to have one's citizenship changed from Registered to Null).
      Where the verb "to register" or "to deregister" is used without
      an explicit direct object, the action is implicitly reflexive.

      A person CAN register, unless prevented by the rules, by
      announcing that e registers, wishes to register, requests
      registration, or requests permission to register.

      A player CAN deregister by announcement.  E CANNOT register
      within thirty days after doing so.

      A player who is not a person and has never been a first-class
      person CAN be deregistered by any player by announcement.

[Restores the clear definitions of "register" and "deregister" that
don't assume reflexivity.]
