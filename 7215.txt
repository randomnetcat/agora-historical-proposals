Amend Rule 2362 (Rubles) by removing:

     Ownership of rubles is restricted to persons.

Amend Rule 103 (The Speaker) by replacing the second paragraph with:

     Each player has a Speaker Account.  The office of Speaker is
     held by the single player whose Speaker Account owns more rubles
     than any other, or is vacant if there is no such player.  At the
     start of each week, each Speaker Account which owns at least as
     many rubles as any other loses one ruble (if it has any).

[Intentionally protected from ruble decay, to encourage saving rubles
in Speaker Accounts and effectively taking turns for Speaker.]

Amend Rule 2362 (Rubles) by appending:

     At the start of each month (after weekly destruction, if it
     coincides with the start of a week), each player gains a ruble
     for each Postulated office e holds.
