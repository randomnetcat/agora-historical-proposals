Enact a rule with title "Deputisation" and text

      Any player (a deputy) CAN perform an action as if e held a
      particular office (deputise for that office) if:

      (a) the rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
          holding that office, to perform the action (or, if the
          office is vacant, would so require if the office were
          filled); and

      (b) a time limit by which the rules require the action to be
          performed has expired; and

      (c) the deputy announced at least two days earlier that e
          intended to deputise for that office for the purposes of the
          particular action; and

      (d) it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
          other than by deputisation, if e held the office.

[The useful part of timing orders, clarified and without using an
order.  The order for the officer to perform was always redundant,
because a requirement of the procedure is that the officer is obliged
to perform the action anyway.  The order didn't create any new
obligation, so we might as well dispense with it.  With orders not
being part of the procedure, there's now no problem if the office is
vacant or its holder changes.  The minimum notice for deputisation is
reduced from a week to two days, because a week (apparently intended
to let the officer satisfy eir `new' obligation) slows things down too
much when this procedure is required.]

Amend rule 1006 by deleting the paragraph which contains the words
"Timing Order".

[The new mechanism replaces the use of Timing Orders.]

Repeal rules 1793, 1794, 1795, 1799, and 1810.

[The Order system is obsolete.  With Timing Orders gone, the only
remaining type of Order would be Legislative Orders, but a proposal
can do whatever it wants anyway without requiring this bulky mechanism
in the ruleset.]
