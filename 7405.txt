Title: Nerf VCs
Author: omd
Co-authors: 
Adoption index: 2

Amend Rule 2389 (Ordinary Chamber) by replacing:

      Whenever a proposal is adopted, its author gains a number of
      VCs equal to the integer part of the proposal's adoption index,
      and each of the proposal's co-authors who is a first-class
      player gains one VC.

with:

      Whenever a proposal is adopted, its author gains one VC.

and by replacing "gains two VCs", if present, with "gains one VC".

[Higher-AI proposals aren't necessarily or generally better,
especially not N times as valuable as an AI-1 proposal, and the
current system seems to allow for very fast voting limit increases.
The last bit nerfs my own salary proposal because the original salary
is intended to keep pace with proposal awards.]
