     common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that

     Casting a vote denouncing another voter is equivalent to
     conditionally casting a vote whose value is opposite to the most
     common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
     decision.  FOR and AGAINST are opposites; PRESENT is its own
     opposite.
