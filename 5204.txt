Title: truthfulness in registration

Amend rule 869 by appending to the paragraph that describes how to
register the sentence

      Any entity that CANNOT register MUST NOT make such an
      announcement.

[This adds a R2149-like requirement for truthfulness in purported
registrations.  Should discourage shenanigans such as Peekee's recent
fake registration, though obviously it has no practical power over the
truly malicious.]
