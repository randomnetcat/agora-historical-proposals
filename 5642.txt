Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing this text:

     * FINE, appropriate for rule breaches of small consequence.
       When in effect, the ninny SHALL within 72 hours destroy one of
       eir Notes.  The ninny is only obliged to perform one
       destruction per question on sentencing, even if sentences of
       this type are assigned more than once or go into effect more
       than once.

with this text:

    * FINE with an amount of one currency, appropriate for rule
      breaches of small consequence.  An amount is only valid if the
      currency's backing document binds the ninny or the ninny has
this amount of the currency, and the backing document specifies a
      maximum FINE amount, and the amount is no greater than the
      maximum.  When in effect, the ninny SHALL within 72 hours either
      destroy this amount of eir currency or transfer it to the Lost
      and Found Department.  The ninny is only obliged to perform one
      destruction or transfer per question on sentencing, even if
      sentences of this type are assigned more than once or go into
      effect more than once.
