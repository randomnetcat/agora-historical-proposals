     A Team achieves a Team Win when its Team Score reaches the Team
     Points Goal, as set in the Scorekeepor's Budget.  When this
     occurs, no other Team may achieve a Team Win until after the
     next Score Reset.

     The Scorekeepor shall announce a Team Win as soon as possible
     after it occurs.  Upon this announcement, a Score Reset occurs.

     Teamwork to each Winner.

     In the announcement, the Scorekeepor shall reassign Players to
     Teams as follows, based on Scores immediately before the Score
     Reset:

     1) The Player with the highest Score in the Team with the
        highest Team Score is assigned to the Team with the lowest
        Team Score.

     2) The Player who has the lowest Score in the Team with the
        lowest Team Score is assigned as to distribute the players as
        evenly as possible among the Teams.

     3) All other Players remain assigned to the same Teams.

     If in any of the above there is a choice of more than one Player
     or Team, the Scorekeepor shall choose between the applicable
     Players or Teams as e sees fit.  The Scorekeepor shall include
     the details of the reassignments in eir announcement.
