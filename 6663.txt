Amend Rule 955 (Determining the Will of Agora) by replacing section
(a) with this text:

       (a) If

            i) there is more than one available option, and the number
               of distinct voters who submitted valid ballots is less
               than quorum, or

           ii) the decision satisfies one or more blocking conditions,

           then the outcome is FAILED QUORUM, regardless of the
           remainder of this rule.  Otherwise, the decision achieved
           quorum.

[Parallel construction with Losing Conditions.]

Amend Rule 2177 (The Senate) by replacing this text:

       While a proposal is in filibuster, its quorum is the number of
       eligible voters plus one, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

with this text:

       Being in filibuster is a blocking condition for the decision on
       whether to adopt that proposal.
