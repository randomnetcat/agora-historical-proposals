Amend rule 1430 (Mandatory Rule Annotations) to read:

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeeper shall
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating:

      (a) the type of change;
      (b) if the rule was changed due to a proposal, a reference to
          that proposal, its proposer, and any coauthors explicitly
          named in that proposal;
      (c) if the rule was changed by some other mechanism, the
          mechanism which specified the change; and
      (d) the date on which the change took effect.

      Other rules may require additional information to appear in an
      annotation for certain types of Rule Change.

      Annotations to a rule are not part of the rule, and annotating a
      rule is not a rule change.  The Rulekeepor shall indicate all
      annotations in such a way that they are readily distinguished
      from the text of the rule.

      When a rule is repealed, all annotations attached to it are
      discarded, and need not appear in the published Ruleset.
