Amend rule 649 by adding after "set out in the Rules." the sentence

      The Herald's report shall include a list of each Patent Title
      that at least one person Bears, with a list of which persons
      Bear it.

Amend rule 1377 to read

      The Herald is an office; its holder is responsible for keeping
      track of marks of honour and shame relating to Agora.

[Moves the PT reporting requirement into the PT rule.  Incidentally
removes the "Threat" item, which we're not using, from rule 1377.
Also gives a more accurate overall description of the Herald.]
