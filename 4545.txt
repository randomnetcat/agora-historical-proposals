Change the Power of Rule 594 to pi (3.14159265358...)

      so set.  No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power
      greater than its own.

      any entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing the Power to be
      so set.  No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power
      greater than its own.

      If a Rule would otherwise be given a Power equal to a disallowed
      value, then its Power instead becomes the largest allowed value that
      is less than this value.  If a new Rule would otherwise be given a
      Power of less than 1, the Rule does not take effect.  If an existing
      Rule would otherwise be given a power of less than 1, the Rule is
      instead repealed.

      When a Proposal takes effect, its Power shall be [...]
