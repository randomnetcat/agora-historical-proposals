PROPOSAL TEXT:
Amend Rule 106 by removing:

                                                    This rule takes
       precedence over any rule which would permit a proposal to take
       effect.

and:

                                                      It does not
       otherwise take effect.

and by adding the following paragraph before the last paragraph:

       A proposal with a decision on which the option selected by Agora
       is not ADOPTED does not take effect, rules to the contrary
       notwithstanding.

[Clarify what "it" is, and deseparate those clauses.]
