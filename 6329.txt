Amend Rule 2168 (Extending the voting period) by replacing this text:

with this text:

      if the result would no longer be FAILED QUORUM, or if the
      decision is whether to adopt a proposal and no voter (other
      than possibly the proposal's author and the vote collector)
      has voted FOR.
