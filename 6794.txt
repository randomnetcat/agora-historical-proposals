Amend Rule 2199 (Ribbons) by removing:

       (+W) A first-class player who has never owned a White Ribbon
            qualifies for one. Additionally, when a first-class person
            has been a player continuously for at least three months,
            was never a player before that period, and names another
            player as eir mentor (and has not named a mentor in this
            fashion before), the named player earns a White Ribbon.
