Proposal
First ANF Fix

Amend Rule 1986 by replacing the text in it which currently reads:

       A progressive action may be associated with a role if
       the rules so state.  If an energetic action is associated
       with a role, only players who hold that role may perform,
       or support performance of, that action.
