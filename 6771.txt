Amend Rule 2299 by replacing "The Enemy shall then as soon as possible
post the map of the new journey, marking out only the two new
wormholes and the new Shuttle." with "The initiation of the journey is
invalid unless, in the same message, the Enemy posts the map of the
new journey, marking out the two new wormholes and the new Shuttle.".
