Amend Rule 683 (Voting on Agoran Decisions) by replacing this text:

      (d) The voter has not publicly retracted the ballot during the
          voting period.

with this text:

      (d) The voter has not publicly retracted the ballot during the
          voting period.  ("Changing" a vote is equivalent to retracting
          it and casting a vote with the new value.)
