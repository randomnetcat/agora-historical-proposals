Proposal
Voting Potential fix

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

Amend Rule 2052 (Voting Potential) by replacing the text in it which
currently reads:

      (b) At any time, a Player may, by announcement, set their Voting
          Potential to any positive integer N.  The Fee associated
          with this action is the Oligarchy Charge Requirement
          multiplied by N.

with text which reads:

      (b) At any time, a Player may, by announcement, increase their
          Voting Potential by a positive integral amount, N. The Fee
          associated with this action is the Oligarchy Charge
          Requirement multiplied by N.

[Comment: the present wording has some odd effects, e.g.: that it costs
the same amount -- 12 kudos -- to change one's Voting Potential from +1
to +2 as it does to change it from 0 to +2.]
