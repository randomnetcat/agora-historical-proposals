Adoption index: 3


Upon the adoption of this proposal, the gamestate becomes what it would be
if all proposals that were adopted since the creation of Rule 1561
(Illegality of Bonus Clauses), and satisfying the following condition from
that rule:

      Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players to
      vote either FOR or AGAINST a Proposal (either itself or another
      Proposal)

had been completely without effect.

Amend Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) to read:

      All Proposals made and distributed in the proper way shall
      be voted upon.  A Proposal shall be adopted if and only if

        (a) it receives the required number of votes,
        (b) it achieves the required number of voters, and
        (c) it is not blocked.

Amend Rule 879 (Quorum) to read:

      The minimum required number of voters for a proposal is

        (a) for ordinary proposals, three;

        (b) for democratic proposals, one third of the number of
            active noisy players (measured when it was distributed
            or became democratic, whichever is later).

Amend Rule 1003 (No Coercive Proposals) to read:

      Any proposal whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a player
      into voting against eir conscience is blocked.

Amend Rule 1561 (Illegality of Bonus Clauses) to read:

      Any proposal which offers a bribe to one or more players based on
      how those players vote or declare presence on a proposal (either
      itself or another proposal) is blocked.  This does not apply to
      bribes offered by a rule, unless the rule would be created or
      amended by a proposal on which the bribe is based.
