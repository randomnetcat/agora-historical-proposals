Amend rule 1728 by replacing the text "action; or" with "action; and".

[Before this amendment, an action to be performed Without Objection
can actually be performed despite objections, on the grounds that it
trivially satisfies (e)(2) which is ORed with (e)(1).  To make (e)(1)
matter in that case it must be ANDed with (e)(2).]
