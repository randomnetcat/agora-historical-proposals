Amend Rule 649 (Patent Titles) by replacing the paragraph beginning
"A Patent Title CAN only be awarded" with this text:

      A person specifically authorized by the rules to award (revoke)
      a Patent Title SHALL do so as soon as possible after the
      conditions authorizing em to do so are announced, unless there
      is an open judicial question contesting the validity of those
      conditions.  Awarding or revoking a Patent Title by any other
      method is secured.

[Restricts revocation.  Removes the proposal-only restriction; rules
could just claim precedence, and if you figure out how to abuse a
non-rule non-proposal instrument then you probably deserve to have it
work.  Does not prevent proposals from awarding Patent Titles normally
awarded by announcement, e.g. to recognize players who satisfied the
condition before it was added to the rules, or satisfied the intended
condition but the actual condition in the rules was buggy.]
