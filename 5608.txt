Amend Rule 2154 (Replacing Officers) by replacing this text:

      If an office is Temporal at the end of a quarter, and no nomination
      period began for that office during that quarter, then the IADoP
      SHALL make at least one nomination for the office during the
      following quarter.  These requirements are waived if another
      player so makes a nomination.

with this text:

      The IADoP SHALL make at least one attempt to install a player
      into an office, and SHALL make the change if possible, under
      the following circumstances:

        a) During a quarter, if the office was Temporal at the start
           of that quarter and no such attempt was made during the
           previous quarter.  This requirement is waived if another
           player makes such a change during the current quarter.

        b) Within a week (or month, if the office is low-priority)
           after the office ceases to have an active holder.  This
           requirement is waived if the office comes to have an
           active holder during that week (month).
