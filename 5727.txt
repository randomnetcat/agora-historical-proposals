{Append the following paragraph to rule 2166:

{The face value of a currency in itself is 1. The face value of any
other asset in a currency is whatever the currency's backing document
says it is, or 0 by default. Any person CAN exchange an asset for its
face value by announcement. If a person is required to possess,
create, destroy, or transfer at least a certain amount of a currency,
they MAY instead possess, create, destroy, or transfer assets whose
face value adds up to at least that amount of the currency.}}
