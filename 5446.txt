Enact a new rule with power 1, entitled "Nomic Definitions", with text as
follows:

     A nomic ruleset is a set of explicit rules that provides means
     for itself to be altered arbitrarily, including changes to those
     rules that govern rule changes. Not all rule changes need be
     possible in one step; an arbitrarily complex combination of
     actions (possibly including intermediate rule changes) can be
     required, so long as any rule change is theoretically achievable
     in finite time.

     A nomic is the single entity defined by a nomic ruleset as a whole.
     Each nomic ruleset defines exactly one nomic, and each nomic is
     defined by exactly one nomic ruleset.

     A foreign nomic is a nomic that is not Agora. Adopting the name of
     "Agora" does not disqualify a nomic from being foreign; any nomic that
     is not the One True Agora is a foreign nomic.

     A province is a protectorate that is registered as a player.
