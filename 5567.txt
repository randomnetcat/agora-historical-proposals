Create a rule with the following text, and a title of
"In Case of Emergency", then set its power to 3.1:
{{{
The set of Definite Players is {ais523, avpx, BobTHJ, cdm014,
comex, doopy, ehird, Eris, Ivan Hope, Murphy, OscarMeyr, Pavitra,
pikhq, Quazie, root, Schrodinger's Cat, woggle, Wooble, Zefram}.

A Definite Message is a message sent to all Definite Players,
or to a mailing list which all Definite Players are likely to be
subscribed to, by a Definite Player.

This rule can be amended to change the set of Definite Players
to any set of people, as long as a Definite Player declared eir
intention to do so in an Definite Message between four and
fourteen days before the amendment happened, by stating that
this action is being taken in a Definite Message, along with
the new set of Definite Players. This should not be done except
to set the set of Definite Players to the set of players defined
by other rules as "active first-class players", and should be
done at any point where those two sets differ.

An Emergency Refresh is a set of changes to the rules and/or
gamestate, clearly labeled as an Emergency Refresh, written in
a Definite Message sent within the last fourteen days.

Any Definite Player can Accept an Emergency Refresh, by stating
that e Accepts it in a Definite Message.

When an Emergency Refresh has been Accepted by at least four-
fifths of the Definite Players, the rules and/or gamestate
change as specified in that Emergency Refresh, regardless of
what any other rule may state.

All words in this rule have their normal English meaning except
as defined in this rule, and their meanings cannot be overriden
by any other entity.

This rule takes precedence over all rules which contradict it in
any way.
