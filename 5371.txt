Amend rule 591 by replacing "any person" with "any first-class
person".

Amend rule 1504 by replacing "any player" with "any first-class person
who is a member of the basis of any player" and replacing "defendant
are each unqualified" with "each member of the defendant's basis are
unqualified".

Amend rule 2169 by replacing "The parties to the contract are all
unqualified" with "The members of the bases of the parties to the
contract are all unqualified".

[No more getting round the disqualification rules by use of
partnerships.  Automatic disqualifications of subjects (criminal
defendant and equity party) affect all members of a person's basis,
rather than just the (possibly second-class) person.  For inquiry and
criminal cases, initiation (with its automatic disqualification) is
restricted to first-class persons, rather than similarly broaden the
disqualification.]
