Amend rule 105 by appending after the item "(e) change the power of a
rule." the item:

      (f) restore a former rule which is presently not a rule.
          When restored, the former rule becomes a rule once more.
          All substantive aspects of the restored rule, other than its
          power, are identical to what they were at the instant the rule
          most recently ceased to be a rule.  The restored rule has  
power
          equal to the minimum of the power specified by the restoring
          instrument, defaulting to one if the restoring instrument does
          not specify, and the maximum power permitted by other rules.
