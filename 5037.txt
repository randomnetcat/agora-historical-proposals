GreyKnight, having devised the blazon contained within this proposal,
is a coauthor of this proposal.

Enact a rule titled "Agoran Arms" with text

      The escutcheon of Agora is defined by the following blazon:
      Tierced palewise sable, argent, and sable, charged with a quill
      and an axe in saltire, proper, and in the chief a capital letter
      A, gules.

[The blazon was given by proposal 4898, but not put in a rule, so that
proposal is probably ineffective in creating a lasting definition.
This proposal corrects the term "coat of arms" from P4898 to
"escutcheon"; the escutcheon (shield) is all that the blazon defines,
but a coat of arms would also include a helmet, crest, supporters, and
possibly other elements.  We don't have a full coat of arms for Agora
yet.]
