Adoption index: 1.7

Amend Rule 911 (Appeal Cases) by replacing this text:

      The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of an appeal case
      are the judicial panels consisting of three members, where each
      of the members is qualified to be assigned as judge of the prior
      case and none of the members is the prior judge.

with this text:

      The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of an appeal case
      are the judicial panels consisting of max(3,1+2*R) members (where
      R is the rank of the prior case), where each of the members is
      qualified to be assigned as judge of the prior case and none of
      the members is the prior judge.

[Inspired by Rule 384/0]

[note: this and Binding Inquiry Cases can be adopted in either order;
if this is adopted first, then BIC still replaces the "third paragraph"
of R911; if BIC is adopted first, then this becomes a no-op because the
old text is no longer present, thus failing to break BIC]
