 {
  if any of the players of this game should find themselves in any
other game of Nomic, they must make this motion in that game of Nomic
if it has not been made in that game yet, and if this motion comes up
for voting, they must vote for it. The motion must be modified to fit
the motion protocol of that game, but no more.
