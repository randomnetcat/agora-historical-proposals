Adoption index: 3

[Puts "Effects are effective" back into "re-jiggery" and unites it
  all together; effects with effects, causes with causes].

If proposal 7083 has not been adopted, the rest of this proposal has
no effect.

Amend R106 to read:
    If the option selected by Agora on a decision about whether to
    adopt a proposal is ADOPTED, then the proposal in question is
    adopted, and unless other rules prevent it from taking effect,
    its power is set to the minimum of four and its adoption index,
    and then it takes effect.  Except as prohibited by other rules,
    a proposal that takes effect CAN and does, as part of its effect,
    apply the changes that it specifies.  If the proposal cannot make
    some such changes, this does not preclude the other changes from
    taking place.

    If there is no Agoran Decision to adopt a particular proposal that
    has an outcome of ADOPTED, that proposal CANNOT take effect, rules
    to the contrary notwithstanding.

    Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change;
    this does not apply to generally preventing changes to specified
    areas of the gamestate, nor to a proposal preventing itself from
    taking effect (its no-effect clause is generally interpreted as
    applying only to the rest of the proposal).


Amend the Rule entitled "Proposals" by amending its first paragraph
to read:

    A proposal is a fixed body of text which has been made into a
    proposal using a process specifically described in the Rules.
