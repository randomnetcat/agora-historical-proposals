Change the title of rule 1932 (Shareholders and the Corporation) to
"Shares and Shareholders", and amend it to read:

      A Stock Card is a card with the Element "Shares [X]".

      The Share Holdings of an entity is the number of Shares
      possessed by that entity.  The Number of Shares is the sum of
      the Share Holdings of all entities.

      A Shareholder is an entity with positive Share Holdings.  A
      Plebeian is a player who is not a Shareholder.  The Corporation
      is the collection of all Shareholders.

Repeal rule 1963 (Eligible Shareholders).

Amend rule 1483 (Definition of Proposals) to read:

      A proposal is a document outlining changes to be made to Agora,
      including enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making
      other explicit changes to the gamestate.

      A legislator submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
      indication that it is intended to become a proposal.  As soon as
      possible afterward, the Promotor shall add this proposal to the
      Proposal Pool.

      Before the Promotor distributes a proposal, its proposer may
      modify its adoption index by announcement.  The default adoption
      index of a proposal is one.

      All players are legislators.

Repeal rule 1953 (Sane Proposals).

Amend rule 1952 (Making Proposals Distributable) to read:

      The Promotor shall have a budget containing the per-player
      proposal limit, which shall be a positive integer defaulting to
      four.

      Depth is a stuck proposal switch with values undistributable and
      distributable.

      Before the Promotor distributes a proposal, its proposer may
      flip its depth by announcement as long as the number of eir
      distributable proposals which have been submitted but have not
      been distributed or retracted is less than the per-player
      proposal limit.

Repeal rule 2021 (Chamber Procedure).
