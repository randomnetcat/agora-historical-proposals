Create a rule with power 1.5 with the following text:
Certain patent titles are of the Order of Agora. These patent titles are:
- Knight Grand Officer of the Order of Agora
- Knight Commander of the Order of Agora
- Commander of the Order of Agora
- Officer of the Order of Agora
- Member of the Order of Agora

The above are ranked in the order they appear in this rule, with titles listed
later being ranked lower.

A person may only have one patent title from the Order of Agora. If a person
would be granted a higher title from the Order of Agora than e currently has,
then the lower such title is revoked when the higher title is awarded.

The Order of Agora SHOULD only be awarded if its new bearer has done a great
service to Agora, deserving of the highest award Agora has to offer.


Upon the adoption of this proposal, First Speaker Michael Norrish is granted
the patent title Knight Grand Officer of the Order of Agora.
