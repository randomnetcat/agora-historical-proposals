[Proposals cost something from 2000-2007, were free since then.
 It affected the speed of play and the care people took in proto-ing
 proposals.  Free makes sense when there are fewer players, but
 with multiple players, care and coordination through support is
 better.]

Amend Rule 1607 (The Promotor) by replacing:
      The Promotor CAN and MAY distribute a proposal in the Proposal
      Pool at any time.  The Promotor's weekly duties include the
      distribution of each proposal that has been in the Proposal Pool
      since the beginning of that week.
with:
      Distributability is a proposal switch tracked by the Promotor,
      with values Undistributable (default) and Distributable.

      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor CAN and SHALL, as part
      of eir weekly duties, distribute any proposal that is in the
      Proposal Pool and was Distributable at the beginning of that
      Agoran week.  The Promotor CAN but SHALL NOT, in a given
      Agoran week, distribute a any proposal that is in the Pool
      but was Undistributable at the beginning of that Agoran week.

      A player CAN flip a specified proposal to Distributable
      with 3 Support, or by spending 1 Note.

      A player CAN flip a specified proposal to Undistributable
      by spending 3 Notes.

All proposals in the proposal pool when this proposal takes
effect are hereby flipped to Distributable (free first round).

[Note:  progressive costs for each flip don't work very well,
as one can just start over with another identical proposal,
promoting proposal-carpet-bombing as a strategy.   For now,
this makes undistributable-making a pay-for option only, we
can revisit the balance with the new economic system.  The
'with support' option might be temporary as well.]
