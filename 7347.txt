Rename Rule 2378 (The Justiciar) to 'Court Protector' and amend it
to read:

      A CFJ may be submitted to the Ambassador-At-Large.  For such a
      CFJ, the Ambassador-At-Large shall perform all duties and
      fulfill all roles that would otherwise be assigned to the Clerk
      of the Courts.  This takes precedence over Rules that would
      otherwise assign duties and roles regarding a CFJ to the Clerk
      of the Courts.  All persons are encouraged to submit a CFJ to
      the Ambassador-At-Large only when there is a good reason not to
      submit it to the Clerk of the Courts.

      If the Clerk of the Courts ever holds the office of
      Ambassador-At- Large, then, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the Ambassador- At-Large becomes Assumed.
