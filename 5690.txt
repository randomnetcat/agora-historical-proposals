      As soon as possible after this rule is enacted, the Mad Scientist SHALL
      randomly choose an integer from 1 to the number of eligible voters on
      this proposal plus the number of distinct voters who voted AGAINST this
      proposal. If the chosen integer is less than or equal to the number of
      distinct voters who voted FOR this proposal, then Rules 2192 and 2193 are
      repealed. When an integer is so chosen, this rule repeals itself.
