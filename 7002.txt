Create a rule titled "Timers" with Power 2 and this text:

      A timer is a switch whose values are the non-negative integers
      (default zero), representing a number of seconds.  Timer values
      and changes can be expressed in terms of larger durations (e.g.
      "1 day" is equivalent to "86400 seconds").

      Each timer is either counting down or not counting down.  When
      a timer has been continuously counting down for 1 second since
      its last change, it decreases by 1.

      When reporting a timer value, it is sufficient to provide enough
      information that its value at the time of the report can be
      calculated with reasonable effort (e.g. "<value> as of <date>
      00:00:00 UTC and has been counting down since then").

Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing this text:

        The ninny becomes inactive, and SHALL NOT become active for the
        number of days specified, as long as the sentence remains in
        effect.

with this text:

        Stasis is a player timer, tracked by the Registrar.  When a
        sentence of TIME OUT goes into effect, the ninny becomes
        inactive, and eir stasis timer increases by the specified
        amount; when it ceases to be in effect, eir stasis timer is
        decreased by the specified amount.  While a player is inactive,
        eir stasis timer is counting down.  While a player's stasis
        timer is positive, e SHALL NOT become active.
