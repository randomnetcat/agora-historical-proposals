Adoption index: 3.0

Amend Rule 1551 (Ratification) by replacing "the gamestate is
modified" with "the gamestate is minimally modified".

[If e.g. a report saying "X has either Y or Z widgets" is ratified, then
if X had Y widgets, then e still does; if X had Z widgets, then e still
does; if X had neither Y nor Z widgets, then that needs to be sorted out
by other means, but that's no worse than the present situation. Also
pre-empts any retarded-monkey claims that ratification performs and/or
ambiguates unrelated portions of gamestate.]
