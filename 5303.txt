Amend Rule 2150 (Personhood) by appending the text:

      The basis of a a first-class person is the singleton set
      consisting of that person.


Amend Rule 2145 (Partnerships) by replacing the text reading:

      A partnership's basis is the set consisting of the union of the
      set of its non-partnership members with the bases of each of its
      partnership members.  Where circularity occurs in this
      definition, it is resolved by using the minimum basis sets that
      provide consistency.
