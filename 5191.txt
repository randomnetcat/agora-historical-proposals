Create a new rule titled "Extending the voting period" that reads:

      Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
      the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting
      period for that decision will immediately be doubled, provided
      this has not already happened for the decision in question.

      Upon such an occurrence, the vote collector for the decision
      SHOULD issue a humiliating public reminder to the slackers who
      have not yet cast any votes on it despite being eligible.
