Amend Rule 1504 by replacing:
      * EXILE with a duration (the tariff) up to 60 days multiplied by
        the power of the highest-power rule allegedly broken,
        appropriate if the severity of the rule breach is reasonably
        correlated with the length of the tariff, the middle of the
        tariff range being appropriate for severe rule breaches
        amounting to a breach of trust.  While a sentence of this type
        is active, the ninny is exiled.  No entity is exiled except as
        required by this rule.  If an exiled entity is ever a player,
        e is deregistered.  An exiled entity CANNOT register.

Change the Power of Rule 869 (How to Join and Leave Agora) to 1.5.
Change the Power of Rule 2130 (Activity) to 1.5.

Create a new Rule (Power=1.5) titled "Exile and Ostracism", with the text:
{{
      Causing an entity to be exiled is a secured change.  If an
      exiled entity is ever a player, e is deregistered.  An exiled
      entity CANNOT register.

      Causing an entity to be ostracized is a secured change.  If an
      ostracized player is ever Active, e becomes Inactive.  An
      ostracized player's Activity CANNOT otherwise be changed, rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding.
