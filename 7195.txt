Adoption index: 2

Amend Rule 2334 (Timers) to read:

     A timer is a switch whose values are the non-negative integers
     (default zero), representing a number of days.

     Each timer is either counting down or not counting down.  When a
     timer has been continuously counting down for 1 day since its
     last change, it decreases by 1.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, for each player, eir stasis timer
is set to N/86400 (rounded to the nearest integer, rounded to the next
highest integer in case of ties), where N is the value of eir stasis
timer in seconds immediately before the adoption of this proposal.
