Enact a new rule entitled "Church and State" reading
       A cardinal is an active, ready player who is neither the current
       Speaker nor the Associate Director of Personnel.

       While there is a pope, no other player may become a pope.
       Whenever a pope is not a cardinal, e ceases being a pope.

       A notice of papal succession declares that a specified player is
       a pope.  The notice is valid only if it is published by the
       Associate Director of Personnel and the specified player is
       indeed a pope.

       Upon publication of a valid notice of papal succession, the
       current Speaker ceases to be Speaker, the pope becomes the new
       Speaker, and the pope ceases to be a pope.
