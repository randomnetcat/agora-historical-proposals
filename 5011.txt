Amend rule 869 by replacing the text:

      A person who is not currently registered as a player and is not
      prohibited from registering is permitted to register.

      A person registers or deregisters by announcement.

      Whenever a person registers, e becomes a player.

      Whenever a player deregisters or is deregistered, e ceases to be
      a player and is prohibited from registering for the next thirty
      days.

with:

      Each entity at any time either is or is not a player.  The verb
      "to be registered" means to become a player, and the verb "to be
      deregistered" means to cease to be a player.  Where the verb "to
      register" or "to deregister" is used without an explicit direct
      object, the action is implicitly reflexive.  The adjective
      "registered", or its fuller form "registered as a player",
      describes those who are players.

      A person is permitted to register or deregister unless
      specifically prohibited. A person registers or deregisters by
      announcement.

      Whenever a player is deregistered, e is prohibited from
      registering for the next thirty days.

[We have previously had arguments that one could become a player
without being registered, and suchlike.  This defines all the
terminology to avoid such confusion.]
