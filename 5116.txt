Amend rule 2130 by replacing the paragraph

      Activity is a player switch with values Active (default) and
      Inactive, tracked by the Registrar.

with

      Activity is a player switch with values Active (default) and
      Inactive, tracked by the Registrar.  The Registrar's report
      includes the date on which each player's activity last changed.

[This only applies if P5111 "Return of switches" reimplemented
activity using a generic switch mechanism.  It dropped the reporting
of activity change dates, but I think this reporting is useful.  It
makes abandonment of the game apparent.]
