Proposal:  Fool me thrice


Amend Rule 1079 by replacing:
      (a) When a Rule requires a random choice to be made, then the
          choice shall be made using whatever probability distribution
          among the possible outcomes the Rules provide for making
          that choice. If the Rules do not specify a probability
          distribution, then a uniform probability distribution shall
          be used.

      (b) Where the Rules do not indicate who is required to make a
          particular random choice, it shall be made by the Speaker.

      (c) When making a random choice as required by the Rules, a
          Player may rely on any physical or computational process
          whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes
          is reasonably close to that required by the Rules.

      (d) For the purposes of this Rule, tossing a platonic solid or
          coin that is not specially weighted has a probability
          distribution among the possible outcomes that is reasonably
          close to uniform.

      (e) For other methods, the Courts are the final arbiter of
          whether a method's probability distribution among the
          possible outcomes is reasonably close to that required by
          the Rules.

Amend Rule 1926 by replacing:
      The Rules may designate certain pieces of information to
      be secret. Any player who knowingly reveals secret information
      to another player, except as explicitly permitted or required
      by the rules, commits the Crime of Unlawful Disclosure, a Class
      5 Crime. All secret information is deemed private, with respect
      to the Freedom of Information Act.

      containing that information, and announces something by
      publishing it.

Amend Rule 1445 by replacing:
      When an Election is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure shall be
      used.  Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is responsible for taking
        nominations, collecting and tallying the Votes, and announcing
        the results.  The Vote Collector is the Speaker at the time
        the Election begins.

      * Disappearance of Vote Collector: If the Vote Collector
        deregisters or is deregistered before announcing the winner of
        the Election, then the Election has no winner.

      * Nominator: A Nominator is an entity permitted to Nominate a
        Candidate in an Election.  Only Active Players are Nominators.
        Activity is measured at the time a Nomination is sent.

      * Prospective: A Prospective is an entity permitted to be
        Nominated as a Candidate in an Election.  Only Active Players
        are Prospectives.  Activity is measured at the time a
        Nomination is sent.

      * Nominating: A Nominator Nominates a Prospective by sending a
        message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period,
        indicating the Election and the Prospective.  If the
        Prospective is not explicitly identified, then it is the same
        as the Nominator.

      * Candidates: A Candidate for an Election is a Prospective who
        has been Nominated in that Election.

      * Retraction: A Nominator may retract eir Nomination by sending
        a message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period,
        indicating the Election and the Prospective.  If the
        Prospective is not explicitly identified, then it is the same
        as the Nominator.

      * Declination: A Prospective may decline eir Nomination by
        sending a message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating
        Period, indicating the Election.  Upon doing so, e may not be
        re-Nominated in that Election by anyone but emself.

      * Mode of Nominations: There are three Modes of Nominations:
        Selfish, Selfless, or Open.  The Vote Collector may specify a
        Mode of Nominations when e announces the start of the
        Election; if e does not, then the Mode is Selfish.

        (a) In a Selfish Election, a Nominator may Nominate only
            emself.
        (b) In a Selfless Election, a Nominator may not Nominate
            emself.
        (c) In an Open Election, a Nominator may Nominate any
            Prospective.

      * Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the time
        of the first correct and legal announcement that an Election
        has begun, as defined in other Rules.  Such an announcement
        must include the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for one
        Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector outside
        of the Nominating Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy:  Nominations need not be kept secret.

      * End of Nominations: As soon as possible after the end of the
        Nominating Period, the Vote Collector shall publish a list of
        all Candidates.  If e does not do this as soon as possible,
        then the Election has no winner.

      If there are no Candidates, then the Election has no winner.

      If there is exactly one Candidate, then e is the winner of that
      Election.

      If there are two or more Candidates, then a Referendum begins
      when the Vote Collector publishes the list of Candidates.  This
      is a standard Referendum, with the following exceptions:

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is the
        same as the Vote Collector for the Election.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one Candidate for
        the given Election.  Words which are effectively synonymous
        with these are also permissible.

      * Failure of Referendum: If the Referendum fails for any reason
        (e.g. Quorum is not achieved), then the Election has no
        winner.

      * Adoption: The winner of the Election is the Candidate for whom
        the most Votes were cast.  If two or more Candidates are tied
        for most Votes, then the Speaker shall choose one of those
        Candidates, who becomes the winner when the Speaker announces
        eir choice.  The Speaker shall announce eir choice as soon as
        possible after the Vote Collector announces the results of
        Voting.

        Collector correctly announces the identity of its winner.  The
        effect of an Election is defined by other Rules.

      When an Election is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure shall be
      used.  Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is responsible for taking
        nominations, collecting and tallying the Votes, and
        announcing the results.  The Vote Collector is the Speaker
        at the time the Election begins.

      * Disappearance of Vote Collector: If the Vote Collector
        deregisters or is deregistered before announcing the winner
        of the Election, then the Election has no winner.

      * Nominator: A Nominator is an entity permitted to Nominate a
        Candidate in an Election.  Only Active Players are
        Nominators.  Activity is measured at the time a Nomination
        is sent.

      * Prospective: A Prospective is an entity permitted to be
        Nominated as a Candidate in an Election.  Only Active
        Players are Prospectives.  Activity is measured at the time
        a Nomination is sent.

      * Nominating: A Nominator Nominates a Prospective by sending a
        message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period,
        indicating the Election and the Prospective.  If the
        Prospective is not explicitly identified, then it is the
        same as the Nominator.

        has been Nominated in that Election.

      * Retraction: A Nominator may retract eir Nomination by
        sending a message to the Vote Collector during the
        Nominating Period, indicating the Election and the
        Prospective.  If the Prospective is not explicitly
        identified, then it is the same as the Nominator.

      * Declination: A Prospective may decline eir Nomination by
        sending a message to the Vote Collector during the
        Nominating Period, indicating the Election.  Upon doing so,
        e may not be re-Nominated in that Election by anyone but
        emself.

      * Mode of Nominations: There are three Modes of Nominations:
        Selfish, Selfless, or Open.  The Vote Collector may specify
        a Mode of Nominations when e announces the start of the
        Election; if e does not, then the Mode is Selfish.

        (a) In a Selfish Election, a Nominator may Nominate only
            emself.
        (b) In a Selfless Election, a Nominator may not Nominate
            emself.
        (c) In an Open Election, a Nominator may Nominate any
            Prospective.

      * Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
        time of the first correct and legal announcement that an
        Election has begun, as defined in other Rules.  Such an
        announcement must include the identity of the Vote
        Collector.

      * Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for one
        Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector
        outside of the Nominating Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy:  Nominations need not be kept secret.

      * End of Nominations: As soon as possible after the end of the
        Nominating Period, the Vote Collector shall publish a list
        of all Candidates.  If e does not do this as soon as
        possible, then the Election has no winner.

      If there are no Candidates, then the Election has no winner.

      If there is exactly one Candidate, then e is the winner of
      that Election.

      If there are two or more Candidates, then a Referendum begins
      when the Vote Collector publishes the list of Candidates.
      This is a standard Referendum, with the following exceptions:

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is the
        same as the Vote Collector for the Election.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one Candidate for
        the given Election.  Words which are effectively synonymous
        with these are also permissible.

      * Failure of Referendum: If the Referendum fails for any
        reason (e.g. Quorum is not achieved), then the Election has
        no winner.

      * Adoption: The winner of the Election is the Candidate for
        whom the most Votes were cast.  If two or more Candidates
        are tied for most Votes, then the Speaker shall choose one
        of those Candidates, who becomes the winner when the Speaker
        announces eir choice.  The Speaker shall announce eir choice
        as soon as possible after the Vote Collector announces the
        results of Voting.

        Collector correctly announces the identity of its winner.
