Amend Rule 1688 (Power) by appending this text:

      A rule that secures a change (hereafter the securing rule)
      thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that change except as
      allowed by an instrument with power greater than or equal to
      the change's power threshold.  This threshold defaults to the
      securing rule's power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that rule.

Amend Rule 1367 (Degrees) by replacing the sentence beginning "A degree
CAN be awarded" with "The awarding of a degree is a secured change".

Amend Rule 2126 (Voting Credits) by replacing the sentence beginning
"VCs CANNOT be affected" with "Changes to VC holdings are secured.".

Amend Rule 2156 (Voting on Ordinary Proposals) by replacing the sentence
beginning "VVLOP can be modified" with "Changes to VVLOP are secured".

Amend Rule 2159 (Protective Decrees) by replacing this text:

      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument with power 2 or
      greater generally can, as part of its effect, initiate a
      protective decree.

with this text:

      The initiation of a protective decree is a secured change.
