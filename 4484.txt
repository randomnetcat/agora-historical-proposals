Amend R1539 by replacing the text reading:

       A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
       paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
       Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
       Contestmaster.  A Contestmaster may publicly resign at any time,
       at which time e ceases to be Contestmaster.

With this text:

       A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster.  If
       the Contest Regulations specify an Entry Fee, the Player must also

       pay the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A Contestant
       may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the Contestmaster.
       A Contestmaster may publicly resign at any time, at which time e
       ceases to be Contestmaster.
