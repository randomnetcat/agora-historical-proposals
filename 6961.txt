Create a power-2 Rule entitled "The President":

        The President is a second-class person.  The President CAN
        only take actions as explicitly described/caused by a Rule
        or other instrument of a power equal to or greater than the
        power of this Rule.

        A first-class Player CAN cause the President to take actions
        Without Objection, or with Agoran Consent.


Amend Rule 103 (Role of the Speaker) by changing its title to
"The Speaker" and amending it to read:

        The Speaker is an imposed office and a figurehead of Agora. The
        Speaker is a person who has proven themselves to be worthy of
        the title, and for a time can direct Agoran government affairs.

        The Speaker is the single first-class player (if any) who holds
        the most Postulated Offices.

        The Speaker CAN, by announcement, cause the President to take
        actions that are not otherwise IMPOSSIBLE, except for
        deregistration.  Causing the President to perform ILLEGAL actions
        in this manner is the Class-6 crime of Misleading the Leader.


Amend Rule 1868 (Judge Assignment Generally) by replacing
        The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of a judicial
        case are the active players who have not previously been
        assigned as its judge, subject to modification by other rules.
        Being unqualified to be assigned as a judge does not inherently
        prevent an entity from continuing to be judge of a case to which
        e is already assigned.
with:
        The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of a judicial
        case are the active first-class players who have not previously been
        assigned as its judge, subject to modification by other rules.
        Being unqualified to be assigned as a judge does not inherently
        prevent an entity from continuing to be judge of a case to which
        e is already assigned.  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding,
        second-class players are always unqualified to judge.


Set the citizenship of The President to Registered.


Amend Rule 1950 (Voting on Democratic Decisions) to read:

       An Agoran decision with an adoption index is a Democratic
       decision.

       An Agoran decision with an adoption index has the following
       essential parameters:

       a) Its adoption index.
       b) Its author (and co-authors, if any).

       For any Agoran decision with an adoption index, the available
       options are FOR and AGAINST.

       The eligible voters on a democratic decision are those entities
       that were active first-class players at the start of its voting
       period.  The voting limit of each eligible voter on a democratic
       decision is one.


Amend Rule 1607 (The Promotor) to read:

       The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
       receiving and distributing proposals.

       Distributability is switch possessed by proposals in the
       proposal pool, tracked by the Promotor, with values
       Distributable (default) and Undistributable.

       The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
       Pool at any time.  In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL,
       as part of eir weekly duties, distribute any proposal that is in
       the Proposal Pool and was Distributable at the beginning of that
       Agoran week.  The Promotor SHALL NOT distribute an
       Undistributable proposal.

       Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
       Promotor.

       The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
       Proposal Pool.


Amend Rule 2230 (Notices of Violation) by removing:
       If a NoV is Uncontested and was published at least four days
       ago, any player CAN cause it to become Closed by announcement.
       Any player CAN cause a NoV specifying em as Accused to become
       Closed by announcement. When a NoV becomes Closed, a number of
       Rests are created in the possession of the Accused equal to the
       Class of the specified Crime, or in its absence the Power of the
       violated rule, rounded up.  If a Closed NoV becomes Contested,
       these Rests remain, but CAN be later destroyed by judicial
       processes as described elsewhere.


Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by removing:
       When a judicial question on culpability is judged after a number
       of rests have been created in the Accused's possession due to
       the associated notice, those rests are destroyed.
and by removing:
       * SILENCE with a positive number less than 15 (X). If a
         judgement of SILENCE has been in effect continuously for one
         week (or longer), any player CAN once create a number of Rests
         equal to X in the possession of the ninny, by announcement.


Amend Rule 2277 (Appeals of Criminal Cases) by removing:
       If a verdict or sentence that led to the creation of Rests is
       overruled, remanded, or reassigned, the Rests are still
       considered to have been created, but any player CAN destroy any
       Rests thus created by announcement.
