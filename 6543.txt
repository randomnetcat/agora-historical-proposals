So as to punish Walker for eir repeated attempts to do ridiculous things
(like transfer assets from the LFD to himself) without objection, inevitably
resulting in someone having to object, and then, when I objected to
several of these attempts, attempting to make me inactive (when I clearly
am not inactive).

Create 2 rests in the possession of Walker.

With this mild punishment, e may learn that such annoying actions are
not within the spirit of the game.
