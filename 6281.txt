In Rule 2126, replace #6 under "Notes CAN be spent (destroyed) as
follows:" with:

      (6) During Agora's Birthday, a player CAN spend Notes forming
          the melody "Happy Birthday" (GGAGCB GGAGDC GGGECBA FFECDC or
          a translation thereof) to satisfy the Winning Condition of
          Musicianship, unless another player has already done so
          using the same translation during that Birthday.
