                          discard one.

      * Not Your Turn  -  cancel a card play that occured in the last
                          24 hours; HOWEVER; if this would lead at any
                          time in the 24 hours after playing to a
                          paradox which would prevent its play, its
                          play is unsuccessful.

[The change to Your Turn is substantiative, the others should not be.
