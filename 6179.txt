Create the following 2-power rule named {Contractual Offices}:
{{
      A contract may define an office. Such an office is called a
      contractual office, is imposed and has interest index 0. The
      defining contract sets all other parameters of the office. A
      contractual office may have its officer selected by any means set
      out within the contract. All obligations under a contractual
      office, including ones defined by rules, are obligations under the
      contract defined by the office, and thus cannot be imposed on
      non-parties.
}}

Amend rule 1006, Offices, by replacing the first paragraph with the
following:
{{
      An office is a role defined as such by the rules, or by a contract
      as permitted by the rules. Each office is either vacant (default)
      or filled (held) by exactly one player. An officer is the holder
      of an office, who may be referred to by the name of that office.
}}

Amend rule 2227, Interest Index of Offices, by replacing {an office}
with {a non-contractual office}.

Amend rule 2160, Deputisation, by adding another bullet, reading as follows:
{{
      (e) If the office is a contractual office, e is a party to the
          contract defining it.
}}

Amend rule 2136, Contests, by replacing the first sentence with:
{{
      Contestmaster is a public contract switch, tracked by the
      Scorekeepor, with values 'none' (default), all first-class
      players, and all contractual offices.
}},
by replacing bullet c) in the first list with:
{{
       c) Doing so would flip the contestmaster of a contract to a
          player who has not explicitly consented to be contestmaster of
          that contest, or to an office whose holder has not explicitly
          consented to be contestmaster of that contest. (If a player
          intends to flip the contestmaster of a contract to emself or
          to an office e holds, this is considered explicit consent to
          be contestmaster of that contract.)
}},
by replacing the second-to-last paragraph with:
{{
      Notwithstanding the rest of this rule, it is IMPOSSIBLE to flip
      the contestmaster of a contract to a player who is not party to
      that contract or to an office defined by that contract; and if a
      contract's contestmaster ceases to be party to that contract or an
      office defined by that contract, that contract's contestmaster is
      flipped to 'none'.
}},
and by adding a new paragraph directly before the last one, with the
following text:
{{
      If a contest's contestmaster is an office, it is IMPOSSIBLE to
      cause a player to fill that office unless e has explictly
      consented to be contestmaster of that contest. This rule takes
      precedence over any other rule which would fill an office or
      provide a mechanism therefor.
