Amend rule 2154 by replacing the paragraph that begins "If, at the end
of this period," with

      If, at the end of this period, there is more than one consenting
      nominee, then officeholding cannot be changed by means of this
      Agoran consent (even if consent was achieved), and the IADoP
      SHALL as soon as possible initiate an Agoran decision to
      determine the new officeholder.  Until this Agoran decision is
      resolved, the office cannot change hands by the mechanism of
      this rule.

      In the Agoran decision to determine a new officeholder, the
      valid options are the nominees, quorum is the lesser of three
      and the number of active players (other rules on quorum
      notwithstanding), the eligible voters are the active players,
      and the vote collector is the IADoP.  In the notice resolving
      the decision, the IADoP will select one nominee from the set of
      nominees which each received the largest number of votes; this
      chosen nominee becomes the officeholder upon the posting of the
      valid notice.

[Adds a missing asap requirement for the initiation of the Agoran
decision.  Some other rewording, and a paragraph split, for clarity.
Incorporates the quorum fix of proposal 5096.]
