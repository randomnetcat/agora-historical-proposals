Amend rule 2410 to replace:

       Party membership is a first-class Voter switch

with

       Party membership is a first-class player switch

[ Rule 104 used to define "Voter" as a player other than the Speaker,
but this clause was repealed by proposal 7486, passed just before the
general election was called. ]
