PROPOSAL TEXT:
Amend Rule 106 by replacing:

       A player CAN remove (syn. retract, withdraw) a proposal e
       authored from the Proposal Pool by announcement.

with:

       A player CAN remove (syn. retract, withdraw) a proposal e
       authored from the Proposal Pool, or amend a proposal e authored
       in the Proposal Pool, by announcement.

[Right now, I think there is a tendency to avoid modifying proposals,
even when, say, a simple change would improve clarity or avoid a
trivial error, because doing so requires re-paying the
Distributability fee.]
