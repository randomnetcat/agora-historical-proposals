"the last Score Reset".

Amend Rule 2053 (Team Points, Team Scores) by replacing the text "the

Amend Rule 2042 (Team Wins) to read:

      A Team achieves a Team Win when its Team Score reaches the Team
      Points Goal, as set in the Scorekeepor's Budget.  When this
      occurs, no other Team may achieve a Team Win until after the
      next Score Reset.

      For the purpose of this Rule, "Winners" refers to Players who
      belonged to the winning Team at the time of the Team Win, and
      "Good Try'ers" refers to Players who belonged to the Team with
      the lowest Team Score at the time of the Team Win.

      The Scorekeepor shall announce a Team Win as soon as possible
      after it occurs.  Upon this announcement, a Score Reset occurs.

      As soon as possible after a Score Reset, the Scorekeepor shall
      award the Boon of Teamwork to each Winner.

      As soon as possible after a Score Reset, the Scorekeepor shall
      reassign Players to Teams as follows, by announcement.  Whenever
      multiple choices of Player or Team are available, the Scorekeepor
      shall choose between them as e sees fit.

      The Scorekeepor may rename any Team in this announcement, if e
      chooses to do so.  That Team shall be known by its new name
      henceforth.
 
          a) The Winner who had the highest Score at the time of the
             Team Win shall be reassigned to the Team that had the
             lowest Team Score at the time of the Team Win.

          b) The Good Try'er who had the lowest Score at the time of
             the Team Win shall be reassigned so as to distribute the
             Players as evenly as possible among the Teams.

          c) All other Players remain assigned to the same Teams.
