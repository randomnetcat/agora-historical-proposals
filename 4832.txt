Change the title of rule 1551 (Documents Subject to Ratification) to
"Ratification", increase its power to 3, and amend it to read:

      A document required to be maintained and published by a player
      can be ratified if and only if:

      (a) the correctness of the document is not under dispute;

      (b) the information within the document has not been superseded
          by a subsequent document which contradicts it and whose
          correctness is not under dispute; and

      (c) the document is not the ruleset.

      If a player attempts to ratify a document, or a legislative
      order executed by the adoption of a proposal would ratify a
      document, then that document is not ratified unless it can be
      ratified.

      The electee to an office is permitted to ratify, without
      objection, an official report e produced and was required to
      maintain by virtue of holding that office.  The Speaker is
      permitted to ratify, without objection, any official report.  In
      either case, a claim of error on such a report shall be deemed
      to constitute an objection to ratification.

      When a document is ratified, the gamestate is modified so that
      the ratified document was completely true and accurate at the
      time it was published.  Nevertheless, the ratification of a
      document does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel any
      messages or actions, even if they were unrecorded or overlooked,
      or change the legality of any attempted action.

      After a document has been ratified, its maintainer shall
      annotate all subsequent publications of that document with the
      date of publication of the most recent issue of that published
      that was ratified.
