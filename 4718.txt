Amend Rule 2078 (Corporate Takeovers) to read:

      Initiative is a stuck player switch, tracked by the Assessor,
      with values Gote and Sente.

      When a player's Initiative is flipped to Sente, eir Voting
      Potential is increased to 4, unless it is already greater than
      or equal to that amount.

      A Takeover Proposal is a proposal meeting these requirements:

        (a) It is labelled as a Takeover Proposal.
        (b) No Takeover Proposal has been submitted earlier in the
            same month.
        (c) It specifies a set of players (hereafter the Corporate
            Raiders) that includes the submitter of the proposal, and
            is no larger than P/2 or smaller than P/3, where P is the
            number of active noisy players at the time of submission.

      Rules to the Contrary nonwithstanding, a Takeover Proposal is
      both Democratic and Sane.

      At the end of a Takeover Proposal's voting period, the
      Assessor shall flip each player's initiative as follows:

        (a) If the proposal is adopted, then all Corporate Raiders
            are flipped to Sente, and all other players are flipped to
            Gote.
        (b) Otherwise, all Corporate Raiders are flipped to Gote,
            and all other players are flipped to Sente.

Amend Rule 1950 (Voting Power) by replacing this text:

                  (i)  that Player's Voting Potential if that Player
                       has Sente.

with this text:

                  (i)  if e has Sente, the maximum of one and eir
                       Voting Potential.
