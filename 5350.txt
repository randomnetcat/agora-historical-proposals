Amend Rule 2019 (Prerogatives) by appending this text:

        e) Wielder of Extra Votes.  The Wielder of Extra Votes at
           the start of an ordinary proposal's voting period has a
           voting limit on that proposal of 1.4 times what it would
           be otherwise (rounded using the same method as the weekly
           update of EVLOP), rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

        f) Diplomatic Immunity.  A sentence of APOLOGY in a criminal
           case is inappropriate if the defendant had Diplomatic
           Immunity at the time of the alleged act, rules to the
           contrary notwithstanding.

and, if Murphy's proposal "Token Fines" has been adopted, replacing
"A sentence of APOLOGY in a criminal case is inappropriate" with "The
sentences of APOLOGY and FINE in a criminal case are inappropriate".

[Mostly identical to Proposal 5298, except this time with sufficient
AI to amend Rule 2019 successfully.]
