Proposal:  The Speaker is Proclaimed by The People

[Conflict of interest between ADoP and Speaker removed.  For
 separation of powers, automatic retirement of ADoP and CotC upon
 becoming speaker is unchanged for now].

[Differs from Murphy's Pope Drew I.  Pope Drew I protects against an
 ADOP who tries to make a pope illegally, but does not protect against
 an ADOP who refuses to announce a pope.]

Amend Rule 402 (Church and State) to read:

      A cardinal is an active, ready player who is not the current
      Speaker.

      For seven days after a cardinal wins the game with no other
      players simultaneously winning, that cardinal may announce that
      e becomes a pope.  Upon this announcement, that player becomes a
      pope, so please treat em right good forever.

      When a cardinal becomes a pope, any previous pope immediately
      ceases being a pope.  Whenever a pope is not a cardinal, e
      immediately ceases being a pope.

      Any Player who is not a pope may install the pope as Speaker, by
      announcement.  Upon this announcement, if the announced player
      is still a pope, then the current Speaker ceases to be Speaker,
      and the pope is installed as the new Speaker and ceases to be a
      pope.

      This installation cannot be performed if there are unresolved
      challenges regarding the pope-ness of the player.  If the
      legality of an installation is not challenged within seven days
      of it being attempted, then it shall be allowed to stand, even
      if is subsequently found to be illegal.
