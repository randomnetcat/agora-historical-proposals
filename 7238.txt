Repeal Rule 2146 (Indices).

Amend Rule 955 (Determining the Will of Agora) by replacing:

     (b) If the decision has an adoption index, then the voting index
         is the ratio of the strength of FOR to the strength of
         AGAINST.  If the voting index is greater than 1, and greater
         than or equal to the decision's adoption index, then the
         outcome is ADOPTED; otherwise, the outcome is REJECTED.

with:

     (b) If the decision has an adoption index, then if the strength
         of FOR is greater than the strength of AGAINST, and the
         ratio of the strength of FOR to the strength of AGAINST is
         greater than or equal to the decision's adoption index (or
         the strength of AGAINST is zero), then the outcome is
         ADOPTED; otherwise, the outcome is REJECTED.
