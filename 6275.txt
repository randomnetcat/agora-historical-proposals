Amend rule 2186 (Victory) to read:
{
      Laurels are a type of asset, tracked by the Herald. Creating,
      destroying, or transferring Laurels is secured. For a person to
      be laureated means for a Laurel to be created in that person's
      possession.

      Winning Conditions and Losing Conditions are conditions defined
      as such by the rules.  When one or more persons satisfy at least
      one Winning Condition and do not satisfy any Losing Conditions,
      all such persons are laureated.  A person CANNOT be laureated in
      any other way, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

      Each Winning Condition should (if needed) specify a cleanup
      procedure to prevent an arbitrary number of Laurels arising from
      essentially the same conditions.  When one or more persons are
      laureated, for each Winning Condition satisfied by at least one
      of those persons, its cleanup procedure occurs.

      A win announcement is a correct announcement explicitly labeled
      as a win announcement and/or clearly stating that one or more
      persons are laureated.

      A person CAN spend a Laurel to win the game. The game CANNOT be
      won in any other way, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
}

Amend rule 2110 (Win by Paradox) by replacing "winner" with "laureate".

Amend rule 1922 (Defined Regular Patent Titles) by replacing "The
Herald's monthly report includes how the player won." with "The Herald's
monthly report includes how the player won (or, if the player won by
spending a Laurel, how e was laureated, assuming that Laurels are spent
in the same order in which they were gained).
