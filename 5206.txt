Amend Rule 2149 (Truthiness, or the Island of Knights and Knaves)
to read:

      Truthiness is a player switch, tracked by the Speaker, with
      values Knight (default) and Knave.

      A knight SHALL NOT publish statements e thinks are false.  A
      knave SHALL NOT publish statements that e thinks are true;
      however, if the rules otherwise permit a knave to perform an
      action by announcement, then the knave is considered to /feel/
      the announcement to be true, and this rule prohibits neither
      the announcement nor the action.

      A player SHALL NOT publish a statement whose veracity e believes
      will be generally misinterpreted by other players.

      Merely quoting a statement does not constitute publishing it for
      the purposes of this rule.  Any disclaimer, conditional clause,
      or other qualifier attached to a statement constitutes part of
      the statement for the purposes of this rule; the truth or
      falsity of the whole is what is significant.
