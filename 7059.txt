Title: Victory case cleanup

[Partly motivated by not wanting to rewrite the CotC DB code to handle
cases that start with a panel, but includes some other things as well.]

Amend Rule 2343 (Victory Cases) by replacing this text:

     The entities eligible to be assigned as judges of a victory case
     are those judicial panels consisting of three first-class
     players, none of them having called the case or been
     disqualified as below. A player can be disqualified from judging
     a victory case with Agoran Consent. The CotC SHOULD NOT assign a
     panel to a victory case if there is a pending intent to
     disqualify one of its members unless it is clear that the intent
     will fail. Players SHOULD be disqualified only if they have a
     vested interest in the victory, such as having been a
     co-scammer.

with this text:

     The initiator of a victory case and the supporter(s) of its
     initiation are disqualified to be assigned as its judge.  A player
     CAN, with Agoran consent, disqualify another player from being
     assigned as the judge of a specified victory case; this SHOULD be
     done if and only if the other player has a vested interest in that
     victory, such as having been a co-scammer.  The CotC SHOULD NOT
     assign a player to a victory case if there is a pending attempt to
     disqualify em, unless it seems reasonably likely to fail.
