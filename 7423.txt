Amend Rule 2150 (Personhood) to read as follows:
      A person is a biological organism generally capable of communicating by
      email in English, including via a translation service. A person CAN
      generally be the subject of rights and obligations under the rules.

Amend Rule 2389 (Ordinary Chamber) by deleting the text "or the total VVLOP of
all second-class players is greater than the total VVLOP of all first-class
players," if it is present, and by deleting the text "for first-class
players and
zero for second-class players."

Amend each Rule, in numerical order, by deleting each instance of "first-class"
(a Rule that would not have its text altered by this is not amended).

Repeal Rule 2328
