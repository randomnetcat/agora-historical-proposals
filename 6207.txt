Title: Fixing Rule 2150 Bug

As Rule 2150 goes on to further disambiguate between biological persons
and non-biological persons, it seems inaccurate to reference ALL persons
as being strictly biological.

Change the second paragraph of Rule 2150 from:

      Any biological organism that is generally capable of communicating
      by email in English (including via a translation service) is a
      person.

to:

      Any entity that is generally capable of communicating by email in
      English (including via a translation service) is a person.
