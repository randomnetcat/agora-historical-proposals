Enact a new Rule entitled "The Machine" with the following text:

     There exists an abstract entity called the Machine. The
     Machinekeepor is an office, and tracker of the Machine. The
     Machine possesses a switch, the Power Switch, tracked by the
     Machinekeepor, with values of On and Off (default).

     The Machine possesses a switch, the Magic switch, tracked by the
     Machinekeepor, with values of Magic and More Magic (default).
     Whenever the Magic switch is set to Magic, the Power switch is
     set to Off immediately and CANNOT be flipped.

     If the Magic switch is set to More Magic, the Machinekeepor CAN
     flip the Power switch to On by announcement. The Machinekeepor
     CAN flip the Power switch to Off by announcement.
