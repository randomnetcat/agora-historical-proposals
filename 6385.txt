Amend Rule 1607 (The Promotor) to read:

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      receiving and distributing proposals.

      The Promotor CAN and MAY distribute a proposal in the Proposal
      Pool at any time.  The Promotor's weekly duties include the
      distribution of each proposal that has been in the Proposal Pool
      since the beginning of that week.

      For an Agoran decision of whether to adopt a proposal, the
      following are essential parameters:

      a) Its author (and co-authors, if any).
      b) Its interest index.

      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.

      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool.

[This is the exact same version as before the recent Distributability
amendment.]
