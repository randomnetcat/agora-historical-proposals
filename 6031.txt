If a rule other than 2218 defines the Winning Condition of Solitude,
then repeal Rule 2218.  Otherwise, amend it to read:

     While all but one player satisfy at least one Losing Condition,
     that player satisfies the Winning Condition of Solitude.

     Cleanup procedure:  The same person cannot satisfy this Winning
     Condition again until at least one other player ceases to
     satisfy any Losing Condition.
