Amend rule 2019 by deleting the paragraph that begins "The Speaker
may veto".  Retitle rule 2019 to "Rubber Stamp".

[The purpose of the veto, to stop ladder scams and other undemocratic
measures being adopted by the undemocratic Ordinary Proposal
procedure, has been superseded by the "Support Democracy" procedure of
rule 2142.  R2142's procedure is superior not only because it confers
immunity to scams even if they involve the speaker but also because it
does not impose the turnaround time of reproposing a wrongly-vetoed
proposal.]
