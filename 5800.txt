     When a foreign Monster becomes a Protectorate, its Recognition
     becomes Protected.  When a foreign Monster ceases to be a
     Protectorate, its Recognition becomes Unknown.  A foreign
     Monster's Recognition CANNOT change to or from Protected in any
     other way.

     The Ambassador CAN, without objection, flip a foreign Monster's
     Recognition to any value (subject to the above restriction).  E
     SHALL inform that Monster of the change as soon as possible.
