Amend Rule 1742 (Contracts) by appending this text:

      A public contract is a contract that identifies itself as
      such.  Any other contract is private.

Create a rule titled "The Notary" with this text:

      The Notary is a low-priority office; its holder is responsible
      for keeping track of contracts.

      The parties to a public contract SHALL keep the Notary informed
      of its text and set of parties.  The Notary's report includes
      this information for each public contract.

      The parties to a private contract SHOULD keep the Notary informed
      of its text and set of parties.  The Notary SHALL disclose this
      information (to the extent that e has been informed of it) to the
      judge of an equity case pertaining to that contract.  The Notary
      SHALL NOT disclose it otherwise, except as explicitly allowed by
      the contract, or with the explicit consent of all parties.

[A private contract not filed in advance with the Notary may be more
difficult to enforce via the courts.  The ability of the parties to
disclose a private contract is not limited by this rule, but may be
limited by the contract.  The ability of an equity judge to disclose
a private contract is not limited by this rule, and cannot be limited
by the contract because Rule 2169 disqualifies all parties from
judging the case.]
