Rights are Concrete

Create the following Rule, "Standing for Rights", power 1.8:

    If an inquiry case purports that an interpretation of Agoran
    Law may abridge, reduce, limit, or remove a defined Right, but
    the CFJ statement does not refer to a specific instance, that
    has actually occurred, in which the interpretation has been
    applied in a way that materially affects game play, the case
    Lacks Standing and the appropriate judgement is UNDETERMINED.
