Amend Rule 1742 (Agreements between Players) by appending, after this
text:

      Players may make agreements among themselves with the intention
      that such agreements will be binding; i.e. that they become
      parties to the agreement and agree to be bound by the agreement.

the following text:

      If such an agreement is registered, then as soon as possible
      after its membership changes, it shall announce which players
      have joined and which have left.  This requirement is satisfied
      if the information is published by a member of the agreement,
      or a person who was a member immediately before the change.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, each registered partnership is
ordered to publish a list of all its Partners as soon as possible.
