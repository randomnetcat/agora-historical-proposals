Amend rule 106 by replacing the text

      The adoption index of a proposal is an integral multiple of 0.1,
      with a default and minimum value of 1.0.  Before the Promotor
      distributes a proposal, its proposer may modify its adoption
      index by announcement.

with

      The adoption index of a proposal is an integral multiple of 0.1,
      with a minimum value of 1.0.  It may be set by the proposer at
      the time of submission, or otherwise defaults to 1.0.

[There's no particular reason to modify the AI after submission, so
may as well set it definitively at submission time.  Errors can be
corrected by withdrawing the proposal entirely.]
