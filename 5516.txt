Anarchy

Create a rule with the following text, entitled "Anarchy Now!":

     If the Rules define an action as regulated, then any player
     may perform that action by announcement.  This rule takes
     precedence over other rules that explicitly limit the
     performance of regulated actions.

[A fine example of a Ladder Loophole.  I'm aware the precedence
claim only works for power-1 rules.  But it also works for higher
powered rules where actions aren't *explicitly* prohibited (hence
the ladder)].
