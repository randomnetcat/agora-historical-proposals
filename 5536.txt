Author: Murphy

Adoption index: 3

Amend Rule 2125 (Regulation Regulations) to read:

      An action is regulated if:

        a) It is IMPOSSIBLE.

        b) It is ILLEGAL.

        c) The rules explicitly state that it CAN be performed while
           certain conditions are satisfied.  Such an action CANNOT
           be performed except as allowed by the rules.

        d) The rules explicitly state that it MAY be performed while
           certain conditions are satisfied.  Such an action MAY NOT
           be performed except as allowed by the rules.

        e) It would, as part of its effect, modify information for
           which some player is required to be a recordkeepor.  Such
           an action CANNOT modify that information except as allowed
           by the rules.

        f) A judicial finding has determined that it is regulated,
           and has not been superseded by subsequent legislation.

Change the title of Rule 1698 to "Agora Is a Nomic", and amend it to
read:

      In the interest of safeguarding Agora's nomic-ness, if a change
      to the gamestate would otherwise make it IMPOSSIBLE to make
      arbitrary rule changes and/or adopt arbitrary proposals within a
      four-week period by any combinations of actions by players, then
      that change is canceled and does not occur, any rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.
