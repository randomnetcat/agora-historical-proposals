Create a Power-2 Rule titled "Certificates":

     A Player who performs one of the following actions without being
     certified for that action has er Voting Limit on Ordinary
     Proposals reduced by two (to a minimum of 0):

     * Submitting a ballot for distributed proposals
     * Supporting or opposing a dependent action
     * Submitting a proposal for distribution

     Players become certified for an action by obtaining a
     Certificate. A Certificate is owned by a player, but is not
     Property and may not be traded or exchanged. Each Certificate
     allows a Player to perform one specific type of action. Each
     certificate has an expiration date. The holder of a Certificate
     may exercise the action specified in the certificate freely
     while that Certificate is valid, unless constrained by another
     rule or binding agreement. When the expiration date of a
     Certificate is reached, it becomes invalid and ceases to exist.

     A Player may hold any number of Certificates, and holding a
     Certificate does not prevent another Player from holding a
     Certificate of the same type.
