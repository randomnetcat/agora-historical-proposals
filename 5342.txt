Cold running justice

Enact the following Rule, entitled "The Justiciar", power-2:

      The Justiciar is an office; its holder is responsible for
      justice and for serving on a Board of Appeals when necessary.

      The Clerk of the Courts (CotC) CAN NOT be made the Justiciar,
      rules to the contrary notwithstanding.  If the Justiciar ever
      becomes CotC, e is removed from the office of Justiciar.

      Whenever the Clerk of the Courts assigns a judicial panel,
      e SHALL assign one with the Justiciar as a member, unless no
      such panel is eligible to be so assigned.

Enact the following rule, entitled "Submitting a CFJ to the Justiciar",
power-2:

      A CFJ may be submitted to the Justiciar.  For such a CFJ, the
      Justiciar shall perform all duties and fulfill all roles that
      would otherwise be assigned to the Clerk of the Courts. This
      takes precedence over Rules that would otherwise assign duties
      and roles regarding a CFJ to the Clerk of the Courts.

      All persons SHOULD submit a CFJ to the Justiciar only when there
      is a good reason not to submit it to the Clerk of the Courts.
