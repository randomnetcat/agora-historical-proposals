       When the Herald is ordered to place someone in the Chokey, e
       shall publically award em the patent title "In the Chokey".

       This title shall be automatically revoked after a length of time
       indicated by the sentencing order, and the Herald shall announce
       the revokation.  If a sentencing order is executed against a
       defendant who already holds this title, the length of time of
       the new sentencing order shall be added to the time left on any
       previous ones.

       A person is considered to be In Disgrace while in the Chokey,
       between the execution and satisfaction of any sentencing orders
       binding em, or if deregistered for lawlessness.  A person who
       leaves the game in disgrace shall be awarded the Patent Title
       Fugitive by the Herald.  A Player may revoke the title Fugitive
       from emself as long as e is no longer in Disgrace.  A non-player
       may have this title revoked by Agoran Consent.

       The rules may further specify actions prohibited to persons in
       particular types of disgrace.

       The Herald is encouraged to publish lists of those in disgrace
       separate from patent titles of honor, to indicate the disgrace.
