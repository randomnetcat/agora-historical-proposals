{{
* IMPEACH from an elected office with a duration (the tariff) up to 60
days multiplied by the power of the highest-power rule allegedly
broken, appropriate if the rule
breach is
related to an abuse of an elected office, or failure to perform
duties, or other things related to an elected office that the
ninny held at the time alleged breach of the rules occured. When this
