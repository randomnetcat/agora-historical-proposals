Create a new rule titled "Ostracism" with power = 2 and the text:
{{
As soon as possible after the beginning of each month the IADoP SHALL
initiate an dependent action to ostracize with a Majority Index of
2/3. If the outcome is APPROVED, the IADoP shall as soon as possible
initiate an agoran decision to determine who is ostracized. For this
decision, the valid options are the players, the eligible voters are
the active players, quorum is 1/2 the number of active players
(rounded down), and the vote collector is the IADoP.
In the notice to resolve the decision,
the IADoP SHALL select the one player who received the greatest number
of votes (if any). For the next 30 days following the successful
resolution of this election, that player's voting limit is 0 on all
proposals. This rule takes precedence over other rules that would
otherwise set or change a player's voting limit.
