Title: Allow Appeals of Paradox

Murphy and Zefram are coauthors of this proposal.

Amend Rule 2110 (Win by Paradox) to read:

      A tortoise is an inquiry case on the possibility or legality of
      a rule-defined action (actual or hypothetical, but not arising
      from that case itself, and not occurring after the initiation of
      that case) for which the question of veracity is UNDECIDABLE.

      Upon a win announcement that a tortoise has continuously been a
      tortoise for no greater than four and no less than two weeks,
      the initiator satisfies the Winning Condition of Paradox.

      Cleanup procedure:  Each winner satisfying this Winning
      Condition SHALL, as soon as possible, make a reasonable attempt
      to resolve the paradox.  The same person can not satisfy this
      Winning Condition again for the same tortoise or for any other
      tortoise that was linked to it in assignment.
