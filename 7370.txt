[Upon review, I guess I misunderstood Judge ais523's arguments in CFJ
3297; however, despite my curmudgeonliness, I still don't think the
fix proposal was adequate.  We seem to be interpreting "constitutes
self-ratifying claims that X" as "is self-ratifying, but self-ratifies
as if it said [only] X", but aside from that being a lot of inference
and possibly being ineffective due to conflict with Rule 1551, it gets
messy when multiple decisions are resolved in the same message,
definitely prevents individual decisions from being CoEd in such a
case (after the fix), and is probably wrong in the unlikely
circumstance that the (entire) message is separately defined as
self-ratifying.  It might be a better idea to revisit the concept of
self-ratification, since it's usually applied awkwardly to "a portion"
or even an implicit part of a message, but in lieu of that, here's
some explicitness.]

Amend Rule 2034 by replacing:

       A public message purporting to resolve an Agoran decision
       constitutes self-ratifying claims that

       a) such a decision existed,
       b) it was resolved as indicated, and
       c) (if the indicated outcome was to adopt a proposal) such a
          proposal existed, was adopted, and took effect.

with:

      The portions of a public message that purport to resolve an
      Agoran decision (including all relevant details reported about
      the decision) are self-ratifying, and imply that such a decision
      existed, and (if the indicated outcome was to adopt a proposal)
      that such a proposal existed, was adopted, and took effect.
