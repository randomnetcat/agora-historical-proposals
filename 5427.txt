Amend Rule 2127 (Conditional Votes) by appending this text:

      Casting a vote endorsing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is the same as the
      most common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on
      that decision.

      Casting a vote denouncing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is opposite to the
      most common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on
      that decision.  FOR and AGAINST are opposites; SUPPORT and
      OBJECT are opposites; PRESENT is its own opposite.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, root is awarded the Patent Title
of Dernier Cri.
