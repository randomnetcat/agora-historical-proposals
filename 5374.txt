Amend Rule 2126 by replacing the text:

      d) A player may spend N+2 VCs, each of a color distinct from the
         rest, to multiply another player's VVLOP by (10-N)/10, where
         1 <= N <= 10.

with the text:

      d) A player may spend N+2 VCs, each of a color distinct from the
         rest, to multiply another player's VVLOP by 1-(N/5), where
         1 <= N <= 5.
