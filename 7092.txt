[ This does not clash with my other victory proposal. ]

Retitle Rule 2343 (Victory Cases) to "Victory".

Replace the first paragraph of Rule 2343 with:

     A person can publish a Declaration of Victory by announcement,
     explaining the Victory Condition they believe they have met and
     how they met it. If a Victory Case is initiated regarding a
     Declaration of Victory, no Declarations of Victory for that win
     can be announced after that point. Otherwise, the person is
     deemed to have won the game of Agora as described in the
     Declaration of Victory one week after eir Declaration of Victory
     is published. The Declaration of Victory's claim that the
     specified player won in the specified way becomes self-ratifying
     at this point. The Herald SHALL award the winner the Patent
     Title Champion as soon as possible afterwards.

     Victory cases are a subclass of judicial cases. For one week
     after the publication of a Declaration of Victory, any player
     CAN initiate a Victory case by announcement, indicating the
     Declaration of Victory e believes to be false and eir arguments
     and evidence supporting this.

and in the same Rule replace "appropriate if the Victory Condition was
satisfied as described" with "appropriate if the Victory Condition was
satisfied as described in the Declaration of Victory" and replace "in
effect for two weeks" with "in effect for one week".
