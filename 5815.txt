Murphy is a coauthor of this proposal.

Amend rule 1789 (Cantus Cygneus) by replacing "Clerk of the Courts" in 
the first paragraph with "Registrar", and replacing the second 
paragraph with the following:

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the
      Registrar shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered. The Registrar shall note the method of
      deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar Reports,
      as long as the Player remains deregistered.

Amend rule 1922 by replacing the text "the Clerk of the Courts or the 
Registrar (whichever one gets around to it first)" with "the 
Registrar".
