Amend rule 1023 by deleting the item that defines "random" and then
changing the letters in all the top-level item labels to form a
consecutive sequence from "a".

[The definition given for "random" doesn't address the difficult
aspects of randomness, where a definition would be useful, and on the
easy aspects it says very little.  As we've abolished all the uses of
randomness in the ruleset, it doesn't seem worth fixing the
definition, so might as well just repeal it.  We can bring in a proper
definition if we later find some use for randomness.]
