remove the following from R1686

"      The rules may specify conditions under which a player is mauve;
      that player is not mauve unless the rules explicitly state at
      least one such condition and all such conditions are satisfied.
      As soon as possible after a player becomes mauve, the Speaker
      shall announce this fact.  The only condition for mauveness is
      being nicknamed Blob."
