In rule 2262, replace
{{{
       * Discard Picking  - Indicate a type of Exploit card where at
                            least one card of that type was destroyed
                            in the past 72 hours; a card of that type
                            is created in your possession.
}}}
with
{{{
       * Discard Picking  - Indicate a type of Exploit card, other than
                            Presto!, where at least one card of that
                            type was destroyed in the past 72 hours; a
                            card of that type is created in your
                            possession.
}}}
[Because otherwise, you can use a Presto! to destroy everyone else's
Discard Pickings.]
