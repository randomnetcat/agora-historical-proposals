Amend Rule 1551 (Ratification) to read:

      For the purpose of this rule:

        a) A document is part (possibly all) of a public message.

        b) An official document is a document labeled as part
           (possibly all) of an official report.  The scope of an
           official document is the part of the official report
           that the official document is labeled as being.

      Any player CAN, without objection, ratify part or all of an
      official document.  The date of this ratification and the
      scope of the ratified document become part of the official
      report in question, until the same scope is ratified at a
      later date.

      Any document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is ratified
      one week after its publication, unless explicitly challenged
      during that period.

      When a document is ratified, the gamestate is modified so that
      the ratified document was completely true and accurate at the
      time it was published.  Nevertheless, the ratification of a
      document does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel any
      messages or actions, even if they were unrecorded or overlooked,
      or change the legality of any attempted action.

Amend Rule 2034 (Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges) by replacing
the paragraph containing "If the success of the resolution" with this text:

      The resolution of an Agoran decision is self-ratifying.

Create a rule titled "Who Am I?" with Power 3 and this text:

      A public message's claim as to who published it is self-ratifying,
      unless the claim is self-contradictory, or a challenge of identity
      pertaining to the claimed publisher has been issued within one
      month before its publication.
