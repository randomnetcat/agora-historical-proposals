Amend Rule 754 (Definition Definitions) by replacing section 4
with this text:

      (4) Any term not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule
          by default has its ordinary-language meaning.

      In determining the meaning of a term, definitions contained in
      lower-powered Rules, followed by definitions used in contracts
      or other Agoran legal documents, SHOULD be used for guidance.

[Extends the latter clause to section 2 as well, e.g. the Power=3
R2141 uses "Rulekeepor" which is defined by the Power=1 R1051.]
