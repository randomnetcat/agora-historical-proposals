Title: Allow contract-defined dependent actions
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: Warrigal
Adoption index: 3.0

Warrigal is a co-author of this proposal.

Amend Rule 1728 (Dependent Actions) by appending this text:

     A person CAN perform a dependent action authorized by a contract
     as if that contract were a rule, provided that the above
     requirements are otherwise met, and that the effects of that
     action are restricted to altering entities and/or attributes
     whose existence depends on that contract.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, the gamestate becomes what it
would have been if all dependent actions that failed, but would have
succeeded if Rule 1728 had always had the above text appended to it,
had instead succeeded.
