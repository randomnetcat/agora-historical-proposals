Amend Rule 2154 (Replacing Officers) to read:

      Any player CAN make an active player (hereafter the nominee) the
      holder of an elected office, thus removing any previous holder
      from the office, with Agoran Consent and the nominee's consent;
      this process is known as installation.

      If, during the minimum waiting period between intent and action
      defined for Agoran Consent, another active player is nominated
      in this way and consents, then the IADoP SHALL as soon as possible
      initiate an Agoran decision to determine the new officeholder;
      this process is known as election.  Until the election is
      resolved, the office CANNOT change hands via installation, the
      remainder of this rule notwithstanding.

      In an election, the valid options are the consenting nominees
      (hereafter the candidates), quorum is the lesser of three and the
      number of active players (other rules on quorum notwithstanding),
      the eligible voters are the active players, and the vote collector
      is the IADoP.  In the notice resolving the decision, the IADoP
      will select a candidate that received at least as many votes as
      any other candidate; this candidate thereby becomes the
      officeholder.

      Stability is an elected office switch, tracked by the IADoP,
      with values Temporal (default) and Perpetual.  Any player CAN
      flip an office's stability without 2 objections.  A Perpetual
      office becomes Temporal when its holder leaves office.

      If an office is Temporal at the end of a quarter, and no attempt
      to install a player into that office was made during that quarter,
      then the IADoP SHALL make at least one such attempt during the
      following quarter, and SHALL make the change if possible; however,
      these requirements are waived if another player makes such a
      change during the following quarter.
