Amend Rule 2161 (ID Numbers) by replacing:

     (b) Such an assignment is INVALID unless the number is a natural
         number (expressed as a decimal literal with at most 14
         digits) distinct from any ID number previously assigned to
         an entity of that type, and (if the type of entity is
         defined by the rules as strictly ordered) greater than any
         orderly ID number so assigned.  The player SHOULD select the
         smallest number possible.
