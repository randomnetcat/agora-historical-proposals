Amend Rule 2177 by replacing this text:

     A Senator CAN call an Emergency Session with 2 Senate
     supporters, provided no other emergency session existed at any
     time in the preceding 48 hours.  An emergency session lasts for
     21 days after being called.  The Assessor's report includes the
     most recent date on which an emergency session was called.

with this text:

     A Senator CAN call an Emergency Session with 2 Senate
     supporters, provided no other emergency session existed at any
     time in the preceding 48 hours.  An emergency session lasts
     until it is terminated.  An unterminated emergency session
     terminates 21 days after it was called.  A Senator CAN terminate
     an emergency session without 3 Senate objections.  Terminating
     an emergency session is a secured change.  The Assessor's report
     includes the dates when the most recent emergency session was
     called and terminated.

When this proposal is adopted, the current emergency session is terminated.
