For Your Safety

[Same as previous Traitor rule, but instead of permanent punishment,
 just locks away seditious folks for the Duration of the Emergency].

Enact the following rule, entitled "Sedition":

    A player MUST NOT provide material support or substantial
    encouragement to another nomic in taking hostile action against
    Agora.  A judge who finds a player guilty of breaking this
    Rule SHALL award the guilty party the patent title Traitor.

    When the Senate enters emergency session, all Traitors are
    instantly deregistered.  A person holding the patent title
    Traitor CANNOT register while the Senate is in emergency
    session.

Amend Rule 649 (Patent Titles) by appending the following text, if
it does not already exist in the Rule:

    If the rules require or allow a player to award (or revoke)
    a patent title, that player CAN make the described award (or
    revocation) by announcement.

[Used to be in the Rules, I thought it still was].
