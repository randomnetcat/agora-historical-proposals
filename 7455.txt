Amend Rule 2170 (Who Am I?) by removing:

      Upon a judicial
      finding that the claimed publisher of one or more messages
      (hereafter the Sock Puppet) was not a person, if any of those
      claims have already self-ratified, then the judge SHALL as soon
      as possible publish a judicial declaration that the Sock Puppet
      was a person during one or more time periods, and SHOULD ensure
      that it corresponds to general belief prior to that finding.

Repeal Rule 2212 (Judicial Declarations).

[The Sock Puppet clause is fairly vague and of dubious general
applicability, since it seems a stretch to equate "Y is an alias for
the person usually known as X" with "Y is not a person".  Since
judicial declarations are just documents that SHOULD be ratified, if
we ever come across a sockpuppet, we can decide the appropriate
document to attempt to ratify at the time rather than trying to handle
every case in the rules.]
