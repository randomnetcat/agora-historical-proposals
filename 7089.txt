[Allows me to distribute proposals submitted this week if there is
volume left over.

(Did I somehow already submit this proposal?)]

Amend Rule 1607 (The Promotor) by replacing:

     The Promotor SHALL NOT distribute any other proposals.

with:

     In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL NOT distribute a
     number of proposals greater than the Legislative Volume.
