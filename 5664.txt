Remove all but the last paragraph from R2196

Create a new rule titled "Chambers" with Power=3 and the following text:
{{
A chamber exists only if defined by a rule that specifies, for
decisions to adopt proposals circulated within that chamber:
 1) The set of eligible voters.  By default, this set is the set of
active players at the beginning of its voting period.
 2) The voting limit of each eligible voter.  By default, this limit is 1.
}}

In R955 replace:
{{
If the decision is ordinary or democratic
}}
with:
{{
If the decision has an adoption index
}}

Insert into R106 after the fourth paragraph:
{{
Circulation is a pending proposal switch, tracked by the Promotor,
with values of all chambers. It CAN be flipped by the proposer to any
valid value at the time of submission, or otherwise defaults to
Democratic. An Agoran decision to adopt a proposal may be referred to
as an X decision, where X is that proposal's circulation.
}}

In R106 replace:
{{
its power is set to the minimum of four and its adoption index
}}
with:
{{
its power is set to the minimum of its adoption index and the power of
the rule defining its chamber
}}
and append to the end of the rule:
{{
A proposal which has neither been withdrawn, ADOPTED, or REJECTED is a
pending proposal.
}}

In R1607 append the following after point b):
{{
c) Its circulation
d) Its adoption index
}}

Prepend to R1950:
{{
There is a Democratic chamber.
}}

Prepend to R2156:
{{
There is an Ordinary chamber.
}}

Change the power of R2156 to 1.9

Repeal R2142

In R2019 replace:
{{
Wielder of Veto.  The Wielder of Veto CAN veto an ordinary
         decision in its voting period by announcement; this increases
         its Adoption Index by 1.
}}
with:
{{
Wielder of Veto. The Wielder of Veto CAN veto any non-democratic
decision in its voting period by announcement; this inreases its
Adoption index by 3.
}}
