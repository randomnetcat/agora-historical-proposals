Amend Rule 2076 by replacing the text that reads:

     Caption:  Not Your Turn
     Elements: Budgeted, Delayed[2]
     Exploit:  You may specify a card play that has occurred
               in the past 48 hours, and (1) that card shall be
               deemed to have not been played, and (2) the gambler
               who originally played that card may not play a copy
               of that card for the next 72 hours.

     Elements: Budgeted, Delayed[2]

               deemed to have not been played, and (2) the gambler
               who originally played that card may not play a copy
               of that card for the next 72 hours.  If playing this
               card directly leads to a condition which would
               retroactively nullify its own play, the play is
               ineffective.
