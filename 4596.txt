Amend Rule 1871 (Turns for All) by replacing this text:

      CFJ, all turned players become unturned.

with this text:

      Whenever an open CFJ has no Trial Judge assigned to it, and
      there are no players eligible to be assigned, the Clerk of
      the Courts shall publish a Notice of Rotation, specifying
      at least one such CFJ.  Upon such an announcement, all turned
      players become unturned.
