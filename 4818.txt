Proposal: Dud raffle

 [Raffle Tickets are basically Duds execept for an interesting
  property once a quarter.  If the maximum deck size is voted in
  with the current limit, having lots of both is a waste.]

The quota for Dud cards is hereby set to the current quota for dud
cards plus the current quota for Raffle Tickets.

The Deckmastor is hereby ordered to, asap, create one Dud copy for
each Raffle Ticket copy held when this proposal clause takes effect,
each in the hand of the Gambler that holds that Raffle Ticket copy.

Delete the card class definition of Raffle Ticket from the Onepower
Cardbook.

Add the following card class definition to the Onepower Cardbook:

      * Caption:   Lotto
        Frequency: Unique
        Elements:  Asleep[61]
        Exploit:   As soon as possible after this card is played, the
          Deckmastor shall randomly select a copy of a Dud in the
          possession of a Player and announce eir selection, unless no
          such copy exists.  Upon this announcement, the Player in
          possession gains three instances of the ephemeral Patent
          Title "Fortune's Fool", and each Dud in the possession of a
          Player is automatically discarded.

The Quota for Lotto is hereby set to 1.
