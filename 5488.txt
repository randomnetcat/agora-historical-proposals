Create a new rule with power 2:

{A face is a type of contract requiring at least zero parties. Every
face represents exactly one foreign nomic, and every foreign nomic is
represented by at most one face. A foreign nomic that is represented
by a face is a person. A person can send a public message on behalf of
a foreign nomic as explicitly allowed by its face.

If the ambassador truthfully makes a public statement that a foreign
nomic's ruleset requests that a face be created for it, or that a
Contract Change be made to its face, the face is created or the
Contract Change is made, unless doing so would result in the nomic
having more than one face, or the face states that it cannot be
changed in this manner. The ambassador SHOULD make this public
statement whenever e becomes aware of the request. This is the only
way a face can be created.}
