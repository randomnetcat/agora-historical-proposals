Amend Rule 1607 (Distribution) by replacing the paragraph beginning
"The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which..." with:

     Priority is an undistributed proposal switch with values of the
     integers (default zero), tracked by the Promotor. A player CAN,
     as a Spending Action, increase or decrease the Priority of a
     specified proposal by one.

     The Legislative Volume is 5 when the Speed is Slow, 10 when it
     is Normal and 20 when it is Fast.

     The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
     Pool at any time. In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL, as
     part of eir weekly duties, out of all of the proposals with a
     positive Priority which were in the pool at the beginning of the
     week, distribute the X proposals with the greatest Priority,
     breaking ties in favour of those proposals which were submitted
     first, where X is the minimum of the Legislative Volume and the
     number of such proposals. The Promotor SHALL NOT distribute any
     other proposals.
