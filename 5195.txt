Amend rule 2110 to read

      If an inquiry case on the possibility of a rule-defined action
      or the permissibility of an action results in a judgement of
      UNDECIDABLE, and that judgement is not appealed within a week,
      then the initiator of the inquiry case wins the game if e is a
      player.  This can only occur once per inquiry case.

[The reformed judicial system provides a clear way to indicate a legal
paradox, so let's use it.  Requiring the use of a CFJ for the win by
paradox avoids a lot of woolliness in the first clause of the current
R2110, and also makes it easier to establish who should get the win.]
