[NOTE: This proposal fixes three loopholes with audits:
 1. It prevents performing multiple audits with one Penalty Box card
 2. It discourages temporarily transferring your cards away to bypass an audit
 3. It discourages announcing blanket intents to audit without
following through]

Append to R2259:
{{
Transferring one or more cards to another entity with the intention of
that having that entity transfer those cards back to you for the
purposes of avoiding penalty from an audit is the class 6 crime of
Laundering. Announcing intent to audit a player with notice and then
failing to audit them within that alloted time is the class 1 crime of
Badgering.
}}

In R2262 under the effect of the card "Penalty Box" after the first
CAN insert the word "once".
