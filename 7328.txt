Enact a new rule entitled "The Dictionary", unless a rule with that
title already exists:

      The Dictionary is a list of common terms and shorthands used in
      playing Agora and their definitions. A player CAN add a
      definition to the Dictionary with 2 support, and a player CAN
      remove a definition from the Dictionary without 2 objections.

      When, in a public message, an entity uses a term defined in the
      Dictionary, unless there is explicit indication otherwise, the
      message is to be interpreted using the definition in the
      Dictionary.  Terms defined in the Dictionary have no effect on
      the interpretation of the rules, insofar as they may lead to the
      formation game custom.

      A definition in The Dictionary cannot cause a message to result
      in an action or other consequence that would not be possible
      without that definition.

      The Lexicographor is an office; the Dictionary is included in
      its monthly report.
