Amend Rule 1742 (Contracts) by replacing this text:

      Contracts are binding agreements governed by the rules.  Any
      agreement made by one or more persons with the intention that it
      be binding on them and governed by the rules is a contract
      (unless it would automatically terminate as a contract).

      A contract automatically terminates if the number of parties to
      it falls below the number of parties the rules require for the
      contract.  If other rules do not specify such a number for a
      contract, then a contract requires at least two parties.

with this text:

      Contracts are binding agreements governed by the rules.

      Each contract requires a certain number of parties (two if not
      otherwise specified by the rules).  Any agreement made by one or
      more persons, with the intention that it be binding on them and
      governed by the rules, becomes a contract when it comes to have
      at least the required number of parties, and terminates when it
      comes to have less than the required number of parties.
