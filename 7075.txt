Amend Rule 1698 (Agora Is A Nomic) by adding the following paragraph:
    For the purposes of this rule, the effects of a single proposal,
    including any actions performed automatically as a consequence of
    the proposal's adpotion, constitute a single change to the
    gamestate and will all be canceled if the proposal would leave the
    game as something other than a Nomic.
