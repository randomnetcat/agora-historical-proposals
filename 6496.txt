Amend Rule 2246 to read as follows:
       A judicial case may be submitted to the Justiciar.  For such a
       case, the Justiciar CAN, in a timely manner and by announcement,
       either accept or reject the case. Until the time limit expires
       or the Justiciar rejects the case, the CotC CANNOT perform any
       duties with regards to the case and does not incur any obligations
       with regards to it.

       If the Justiciar accepts the case, e switches places with the CotC
       entirely with regards to that case; e receives all obligations and
       all powers the CotC would receive, and the CotC receives all
       obligations and powers the Justiciar would receive. This includes
       any secondary duties required to fulfill obligations (such as
       rotating the bench). This takes precedence over Rules that would
       otherwise assign duties and powers regarding a judicial case to
       the Clerk of the Courts or the Justiciar. A player CAN deputize
       for Justiciar to perform these duties as if it were an office.

       All persons are encouraged to submit a case to the Justiciar
       only when there is a good reason not to submit it to the Clerk
       of the Courts.
