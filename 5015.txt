Adoption index: 2

Amend rule 991 by replacing "by submitting a Call for Judgement (CFJ)
to the Clerk of the Courts" with "by publishing a Call for Judgement
(CFJ)".

Amend rule 897 by deleting the paragraph that begins "The Clerk of the
Courts shall publish".

[We are in practice always calling for judgement by announcement.
Might as well make that official and remove the CotC's redundant
obligation to publish.]
