this text:

      Judicial cases can generally be transferred between judges by
      this procedure: an entity (the transferee) CAN assign emself as
      the judge of a judicial case by announcement if:

      (a) the case has a judge assigned (the transferor); and

      (b) the transferor and the transferee are different entities;
          and

      (c) the transferor has previously publicly consented to the
          transfer and not publicly withdrawn that consent; and

      (d) the transferee is qualified to be assigned as judge of the
          case; and

      (e) the transferee immediately (in the same announcement)
          assigns a judgement to a judicial question in the case.

with this text:

      An entity (the transferee) CAN, with consent from the current
      judge of a judicial case (the transferor), assign emself as the
      new judge of that case, provided that e is qualified to be
      assigned as judge of that case, and e immediately (in the same
      announcement) assigns a judgement to a judicial question in
      that case.
