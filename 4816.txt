Proposal: Oscar Night 1.0

[Re-written assuming Cobalt passes]

Steve is the co-author of this proposal, and therefore the Rulekeepor
shall include eir name, as if e were a player co-author, in any
historical annotations added due to this Proposal (I think this latter
legislative order is necessary and legal as Steve is not a Player
[R1430]).

[Because Nth Anniversary ribbons never really went anywhere]

Amend Rule 1727 (Happy Birthday) by replacing:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Herald may select one Contract,
      in existence on Agora's Birthday, which has as its purpose
      encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday.  Within the
      month following Agora's Birthday, that Contract may award its
      Members the Patent Title Nth Anniversary Ribbon, where N is the
      number of years of Agora's existence;

with:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Herald shall initiate an Agoran
      decision to determine a Rule version to receive the Spirit of
      the Game award.  Available options are every Rule version that
      took effect since the last Birthday.  Eligible voters are all
      persons, and the Herald is the vote collector.  The Rulekeepor
      shall add an annotation of each award to the historical
      annotations of change for the winning Rule versions.

Amend Rule 1750 (Read the Ruleset Week) by appending the following
paragraph:

      The Rulekeepor shall, during Read the Ruleset Week, initiate an
      Agoran decision to determine a Rule version to receive the Best
      Rule award.  Available options are every Rule version that took
      effect since the beginning of the last Read the Ruleset Week.
      Eligible voters are all persons, and the Rulekeepor is the vote
      collector.  The Rulekeepor shall add an annotation of each award
      to the historical annotations of change for the winning Rule
      versions.
