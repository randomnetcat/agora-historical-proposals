Title: Promises do an acceptable job of handling this, but a specialized mechanism would probably be more convenient and less error-prone

Create a rule, titled "Trade Offers":

      A person (the Seller) CAN create a Trade Offer by announcement,
      specifying a set of assets e offers to trade (the Wares), and a
      set of assets e wishes to receive in exchange (the Tender).

      Any other person (the Buyer) CAN accept a Trade Offer by
      announcement.  When this happens, if the Seller owns the Wares
      and CAN transfer them to the Buyer, and the Buyer owns the
      Tender and CAN transfer it to the Seller, then the Wares are
      transferred to the Buyer, the Tender is transferred to the
      Seller, and the Trade Offer is destroyed.  If any part of this
      transaction would fail, the entire transaction fails.

      A Seller can destroy (syn. revoke) eir own Trade Offers by
      announcement.  Trade Offers are automatically destroyed 4 days
      after they are created.
