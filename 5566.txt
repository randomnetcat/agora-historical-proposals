Replace the first two paragraphs of rule 2136 with
the following:
{{{
Contestmaster is a public contract switch, tracked by
the Notary, with a default value of 'none', and a set
of possible values which consists of all first-class
players and 'none'.

A public contract is a contest if and only if it has
a contestmaster other than 'none'. The Scorekeepor's
report contains the contestmaster of each contest.

Any player CAN flip the contestmaster of a public
contract without 3 objections, except if doing so
would cause a player to be contestmaster of more than
one contest, or it would flip the contestmaster of
a contract to a player who has not explicitly
consented to be contestmaster of that contest.
(If a player intends to flip the contestmaster of a
contract to emself, this is considered explicit
consent to be contestmaster of that contract.)

Notwithstanding the rest of this rule, it is
IMPOSSIBLE to flip the contestmaster of a contract to
a player who is not party to that contract; and if a
contract's contestmaster ceases to be party to that
contract, that contract's contestmaster is flipped to
'none'.
}}}

Set the contestmaster of all contracts which were
contests before this proposal passed to the
contestmaster such contracts had immediately before
this proposal passed.
