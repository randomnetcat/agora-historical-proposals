Amend Rule 2318 (Motions to Reconsider) by appending the following
paragraph:

       If the judge has not published a new judgement for the case
       asap after the motion is so filed, and remains the judge of
       the case throughout that time, then the prior judgement is
       assigned to the case again.


[Still preferable for the judge to respond, but makes it clear that
  the judge's original opinion has primacy over the motions].
