Amend rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) by replacing:
       When creating proposals, the person who creates them SHOULD
       ensure that the proposal outlines changes to be made to Agora,
       such as enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making other
       explicit changes to the gamestate. When a proposal that includes
       such explicit changes takes effect, those changes are applied to
       the gamestate.
