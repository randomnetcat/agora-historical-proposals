Create a rule entitled "Mute Exemption":

       A Legislator who is Mute may, with two support, submit a body of
       text with Mute Exemption.  This text becomes a Proposal if
       it meets all rule requirements for a Proposal other than the
       Proposer not being Mute.

       As soon as possible after a Proposal with Mute Exemption passes,
       the Assessor shall expunge a number of Blots from the Proposer
       equal to the Adoption Index of the Proposal.  The Proposer shall
       receive no Boons that may have awarded by other rules for the
       passing of the Proposal.
