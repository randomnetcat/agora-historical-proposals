Change the power of Rule 2361 (Slave Golems) to 3, and amend it by
replacing "cause it to take actions that are not otherwise IMPOSSIBLE"
with "send a public message on its behalf".

[The current mechanism has weird interactions with higher-powered
Rules and actions that are performed by sending a message rather than
by announcement, and I am skeptical that my recent scam failed in a
way that is not patchable (unless Golems are generally unable to act).
 In particular, even if the mechanism is part of the specification of
an action, since Golems are *not* sending messages and no rule is
pretending they are, it's equally valid to say "I cause my Golem to do
X without objection" as "I cause my Golem to do X by announcement"
(since "by announcement" is defined with reference to sending
messages) - in both cases the purported mechanism is a lie.  I would
have brought this up in CFJ 3171, but I wasn't thinking straight.
