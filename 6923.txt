Amend Rule 2212 to read:

      A judicial declaration is a document labeled as such and
      published by a person purporting to be the judge of a specific
      judicial case, which contains only information e would be
      required by the Rules, were e the judge, to publish in a
      judicial declaration.

      The author of a judicial declaration SHOULD attempt to ratify it
      without objection immediately after publishing it; players
      SHOULD NOT object to such an attempt unless the judicial
      declaration was invalid or illegally published.

[This is required to avoid brokenness if "Forgery is forgery" passes,
but is probably a good idea in any case; judicial declarations are
rare enough, and the potential consequences of ratifying an incorrect
document severe enough, that the ratification should at least be
treated explicitly.]
