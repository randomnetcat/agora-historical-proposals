Adoption index: 2

Create a rule titled "Decriminalization" with Power 2 and this text:

      If a rule defines a method of breaching it as decriminalized, then
      no person SHALL initiate a criminal case alleging that that rule
      has been breached by that method, unless the defendant intended to
      breach it by that method by performing the alleged action.

Amend Rule 2158 (Judicial Questions) by replacing this text:

      A judge SHALL NOT assign an inappropriate judgement to any
      judicial question.

with this text, followed by a paragraph break:

      A judge SHALL NOT assign an inappropriate judgement to any
      judicial question; however, this is a decriminalized breach,
      and unintentional violations SHOULD be addressed by initiating
      an appeal case concerning that assignment.
