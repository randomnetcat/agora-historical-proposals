[This has been Agoran custom for a long time yet completely illegal. As
Promotor I could be NoVed for this, and really don't want to be.]

Remove all proposals from the Proposal Pool that were in it at the
beginning of the third Agoran week to fall entirely in April of 2009.

Amend rule 106 by adding {A player CAN remove a proposal e authored
from the Proposal Pool by announcement.} at the end of the second
paragraph.
