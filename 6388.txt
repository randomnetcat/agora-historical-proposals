Amend the section of Rule 2198 now reading:
(
      If a contract states that one or more of its switches have
      certain values, then they do.
)
to read:
(
      Upon creation or contract change, if a contract comes to state
      that one or more of its switches have certain values, then they
      are flipped to those values unless such flips would be illegal
      or impossible.
)
