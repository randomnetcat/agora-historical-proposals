This is an Urgent Proposal

Amend Rule 683(Voting on Agoran Decisions) by replacing:
         The voting limit of an eligible voter on an Agoran
     decision is one, except where rules say otherwise.
with:
         Except where rules say otherwise, the eligible
     voters on an Agoran Decision are the active players at
     the beginning of the voting period, and the voting limit
     of an eligible voter on an Agoran decision is one.
