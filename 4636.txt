Create a new rule titled "Naughty Proposals" with Power=3 and
this text:

     If a proposal is naughty (as defined by other rules), then
     none of the provisions contained in its text shall be
     implemented, even if it is adopted, any rule to the contrary
     notwithstanding.

Amend Rule 2034 (Votes are Protected) to read:

     Any proposal that attempts to change an entity's vote on an
     issue is naughty, unless the issue's voting period has not
     yet begun at the time of the proposal's adoption.

     Once an official voting report has been published for an
     issue, no votes on that issue may be changed or cancelled,
    and the outcome of the issue may not be changed in any way,
    any rule to the contrary notwithstanding.  This rule does
     not prevent the correction of errors in such reports.

Amend Rule 1561 (Illegality of Bonus Clauses) to read:

     Any proposal that offers a bribe to one or more players to
     vote either FOR or AGAINST a proposal (either itself or
     another proposal) is naughty.
