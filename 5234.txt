Zefram is a coauthor of this proposal.

In Rule 2136 replace the following text:

       A contest is an agreement that identifies itself as such, and
       identifies exactly one party as its contestmaster; all other
       parties are its contestants.

 with:

       A contest is an agreement that

       (a) identifies itself as a contest,

       (b) identifies exactly one party as its contestmaster,

       (c) allows any First-class player to become a party,

       (d) is published before any contestants become a party to it, and

       (e) is fair to all contestants.

       All parties to the agreement who are not the contestmaster are its
       contestants.
