[Only change:  shorten "30 days" to "in the voting period"]

Enact the following rule entitiled Conditional Votes:

     A ballot option (vote) on an Agoran decision may be
     submitted conditionally, and the truth or falsity of
     the condition and thus the selected option will be
     determined as it exists at the end of the voting period.

     The option selected shall be considered to be clearly
     identified if and only if the truth or falsity of the
     specified condition(s) can be reasonably determined,
     without circularity or paradox, from information
     published within the voting period.
