Amend Rule 2145 (Partnerships) by replacing:
      A public Legalistic partnership whose basis contains at least
      two persons is a person, and SHALL act as specified by itself.
with:
      A public Legalistic partnership whose basis has contained at
      least three active first-class players simultaneously at
      some point in the past seven days is a person, and SHALL
      act as specified by itself.

[The "past seven days" means that if someone goes unexpectedly
on hold or deregisters out of pique, the partnership has time
to try to come up to numbers].
