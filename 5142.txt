Amend rule 2141 by replacing the paragraph

      Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.

with

      Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.  A rule
      CANNOT have the same ID number as any other rule.  Once
      assigned, a rule's ID number cannot be changed.

[This only applies if P5110 "Regulate ID numbers" generalised the
assignment of ID numbers.  The new rule "ID Numbers" says that ID
numbers must be distinct and can't be changed, but that's only at
power=2.  For rules, especially with ID numbers being used to
determine precedence, these things should be enforced at power=3.  The
detailed procedure for ID number selection and assignment remains
separate in the "ID Numbers" rule.]
