[Bug:  The R101 preamble allows a right to be defined by a low-powered
rule ("The scammers have a right to change the rules"), and that low-
powered right would use R101 to go over all rules]

Amend R101 by changing its title from 'Agoran Rights and Privileges'
to 'The Rights of Agorans'.

Amend R101 by replacing its first paragraph with:

     WHEREAS Agora, since its inception, has functioned not only as a
     game but as a society, and WHEREAS a society, to function, must
     balance its Rules with the natural rights of its participants,
     BE IT HEREBY PROCLAIMED that no interpretation of Agoran law or
     binding agreement may substantially limit or remove a person's
     rights as defined by this Rule, except through the explicit and
     legal amendment of this Rule.  This rule takes precedence over
     any rule which would allow or mandate restrictions of the rights
     contained herein.
