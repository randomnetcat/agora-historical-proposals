Proposal:  Ducks!  Ducks!

  A piece of string walks into a bar.  The bartender says,
  "I'm sorry, but happy hour is on exactly one day this week 
  and I guarantee the day will be a surprise."  So the string
  turns to the chipmunk and says "ha!  lucky for me, defecting
  is only worth 3 points!"
