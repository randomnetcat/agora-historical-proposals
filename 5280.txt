Murphy is a coauthor of this proposal.

Retitle rule 2149 to "Truthfulness", and amend it to read

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement unless e believes
      that in doing so e is telling the truth.  Merely quoting a false
      statement does not constitute making it for the purposes of this
      rule.  Any disclaimer, conditional clause, or other qualifier
      attached to a statement constitutes part of the statement for
      the purposes of this rule; the truth or falsity of the whole is
      what is significant.

[Truthiness doesn't work and isn't going anywhere.  This proposal
restores the former truthfulness provision, with an extension: it
applies to all persons, not just players.  This extension is useful
with the present range of game activities that non-players engage in.
Also incorporated Murphy's clearer wording into the first sentence.]
