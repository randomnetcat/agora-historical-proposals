[Depending on how you interpret it, this might block submission of
proposals with an adoption index but no Chamber.]

Amend Rule 2350 (Proposals) by replacing:

     A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text.  A
     player CAN create a proposal by announcement, specifying its
     text and optionally specifying the following attributes:

     * An associated title.
     * A list of co-authors (which must be persons other than the
       author).
     * An adoption index and Chamber.
