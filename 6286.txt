Amend Rule 1551 (Ratification) to read: [added "rules to the contrary
notwithstanding"]
      A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.

      When a public document is ratified, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the gamestate is modified so that the ratified
      document was completely true and accurate at the time it was
      published.  Nevertheless, the ratification of a public document
      does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel any messages or
      actions, even if they were unrecorded or overlooked, or change
      the legality of any attempted action.

      Ratifying a public document is secured.

Change the power of Rule 1698 (Agora Is a Nomic) to 4.

[Currently the order of precedence is R101 > AIaN > everything else,
with Ratification a few rules down.  This proposal changes it to AiaN >
R101 > Ratification > everything else.  Yes, I believe keeping the game
alive is more important than our rights.]
