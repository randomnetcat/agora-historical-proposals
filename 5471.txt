[Extend e.g. voting periods that begin just before a Holiday begins.]

Amend Rule 1769 (Holidays) by replacing this text:

       If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
       another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
       within some time of another event, and that other event occurs
       during a Holiday, the time at which the Holiday ends shall be
       used instead for the purpose of determining the time of the
       future event or of the time by which the Player must perform the
       specified action.

with this text:

       If some Rule bases the time of a future event (including the
       time limit for a player to perform an action) upon the time of
       another event, and

         a) that other event occurs during a Holiday, then the time at
            which that Holiday ends shall be used instead for the
            purpose of determining the time of the future event.

         b) the future event would occur during a Holiday, then the
            future event occurs 72 hours after the end of that Holiday
            instead.
