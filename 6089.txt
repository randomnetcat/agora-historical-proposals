Amend Rule 106 by replacing:
     A player submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
     indication that it is intended to become a proposal, which
     places the proposal in the Proposal Pool.
with:
     A player CAN create a proposal by publishing ("submitting")
     a body of text with a clear indication that it is intended
     to become a proposal, which places the proposal in the
     Proposal Pool.

[E.g. a generic text isn't a proposal until a player publishes it
with a clear intent to make it a proposal]
