Amend Rule 2404 (Proposal Fees) by removing

      A proposal with a proposal fee of 0 is disinterested; proposals
      with positive proposal fees are interested.

Amend Rule 2405 (Distributability) by removing

      ; a player CAN, by announcement,
      decrease the Distributability of a proposal by one for a cost
      of B Yaks

and by replacing ", and b) B is the value of the Undistributability
Fee, a Budget Switch." with "."

[ Shifting the focus to outbidding proposals. ]

Amend Rule 2405 (Distributability) by appending "All proposals are
initially interested; a player CAN make a proposal disinterested by
announcement if e has not already done so in the current week. A
player CAN also make a proposal disinterested without two objections.
If a player CAN make a proposal disinterested by announcement due to
an intent to do so without two objections, then the Promotor CAN also
do so, and SHALL do so before distributing any proposals."

[ Similar to before, but now with one free proposal per week and the
Promotor is required to catch those intents for you, in case you
forget, or if e distributes just after the end of the four day w/o
objection wait. ]
