[In the Cards section, "cost" appears once and "fee" 11 times.]

In Rule 2069, replace the text reading:

      (d) An Exploit is an action that the Holder of that Card (and
          only the Holder of that Card) may take if and only if e
          meets the requirements and/or pays the costs outlined in
          that Exploit.

      (d) An Exploit is an action that the Holder of that Card (and
          only the Holder of that Card) may take if and only if e
          meets the requirements and/or pays the fees outlined in
          that Exploit.

Create a new Rule titled "Card Fees" which reads:

      All fees associated with Card Actions, Elements and Exploits
      must be paid as soon as possible by the Gambler incurring the
      fee. For every Kudo not paid on time, the Gambler commits the
      Class 1 Infraction of Debt Overdue, which may be reported by any
      Player.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules pertaining to Cards
      fees.
