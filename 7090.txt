Retitle Rule 2349 (Spending Points) to Costs, and amend it to read:

     The documents defining the conditions for performing an action
     can define a cost in assets, optionally specifying a recipient
     entity; paying the cost becomes such a condition.  A person has
     paid the cost for an attempt to perform the action if e
     transferred those assets to the recipient entity, if one was
     specified, or destroyed them otherwise:

      (1) in the same message as the attempt,
      (2) clearly indicating that the transfer or destruction was a
          payment for that attempt, and
      (3) not indicating that it was a payment for any other attempt.

Amend Rule 1607 (The Promotor) by replacing "as a Spending Action"
with "for a cost of 5 points".

[And a bugfix - I think, if you felt like performing 50 Priority
increases, you could do it and win with the same points.]

Amend Rule 2322 (Winning by Points) by replacing:

     A player CAN destroy 250 points in the possession of any
     indicated player to cause the indicated player to satisfy the
     Victory Condition of Accumulation.

with:

     A player CAN destroy 250 points in the possession of any
     indicated player (without indicating that the destruction is a
     payment) to cause the indicated player to satisfy the Victory
     Condition of Accumulation.
