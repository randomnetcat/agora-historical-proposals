Enact a rule, titled "Ordinary Chamber", with power 2:

      VVLOP is a player switch, tracked by the Assessor, whose
      possible values are the non-negative integers, and whose default
      value is four.  The voting limit of an entity on an Ordinary
      Decision is eir VVLOP.

      Voting Credits (or VCs) are a fixed currency whose recordkeepor
      is the Promotor. Whenever a proposal is adopted, its author
      gains a number of VCs equal to the integer part of the
      proposal's adoption index, and each of the proposal's co-authors
      gains one VC.

      A player may spend two VCs to increase eir own VVLOP by one. A
      person may spend one VC to increase any other player's VVLOP by
      one. A person may spend two VCs to decrease any other player's
      VVLOP by one.

      Whenever a person's VVLOP becomes 12 or greater, all VVLOPs are
      set to their default values, and all VCs are destroyed.
