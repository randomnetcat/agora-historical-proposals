Amend rule 2126 by inserting immediately after the first paragraph
the text:

      At the end of each month, each player's VC and voting limit on
      ordinary proposals are each set to 80% of their former value,
      rounded to the nearest integer.  These changes occur before any
      other changes to VCs and voting limits that occur at the end of
      a month.

[Avoids inflation of VLOPs.  This gives new players (or newly-active
players) a chance to catch up with the VLOP of established players, by
earning VCs over a few months.  20% reduction each month is very close
to a 50% reduction each quarter, which Agoran Chromodynamics proposed
for its Beads, but compounding monthly is much smoother.]
