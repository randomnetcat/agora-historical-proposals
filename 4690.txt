[I can't believe this rule is only Power 1.]

Increase the power of Rule 478 to 3 and amend it by replacing the text
reading:

      Publicity is a stuck forum switch with values null, Discussion,
      and Public.

with:

      Publicity is a stuck forum switch with values null, Discussion,
      and Public.  A forum's Publicity may not be changed except as
      described in this rule.
