Amend rule 2144 by appending the paragraph

      If a registered partnership has the same basis as another
      registered partnership, it can be deregistered by any player by
      announcement.

[Proposal 5022 curiously drops the restriction (present in the
original rule 214) on registered partnerships changing basis to match
another registered partnership, opening a loophole.  This proposal
revives the restriction.  This version matches the pragmatic procedure
of the final paragraph of rule 869 (which applies to players that
cease to be persons), avoiding the problems of automatic unnotified
deregistration that occur with the original version of rule 2144.]
