with
{{{
      Cleanup procedure:  All those players have eir scores set to 0.
      Unless all those players gained at least 80 points (of any
      type) total within a 10-minute period within the past months,
      then all other players have each of eir coordinates set to
      floor(P*S/10), where P is eir previous coordinate along that
      axis and S is the Score Index.
}}}

by High Score between the time this proposal was submitted and the time
at which it passed) comex to what it would be if no cleanup procedure
from Wins by High Score had been performed within the last month.
