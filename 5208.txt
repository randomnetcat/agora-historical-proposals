Amend Rule 478 (Fora) by replacing this text:

      A message is public if and only if it is sent via a public forum
      or is sent to all players and contains a clear designation of
      intent to be public.  A player "publishes" or "announces"
      something by sending a public message.

      A player performs an action "by announcement" by announcing that
      e performs it.  Any action performed by sending a message is
      performed at the time date-stamped on that message.

with this text:

      A message is public if and only if

        a) it is sent via a public forum, or

        b) it is sent to all players and contains a clear designation
           of intent to be public.

      A person "publishes" or "announces" something by sending a
      public message.  Each public message is considered to be sent
      by the person it identifies as its sender, unless an inquiry
      case to determine the veracity of this identification has a
      judgement other than TRUE, in which case it has no effect
      (rules to the contrary notwithstanding).

      A person performs an action "by announcement" by announcing that
      e performs it.  Any action performed by sending a message is
      performed at the time date-stamped on that message.
