Amend Rule 2389 (Ordinary Chamber) by appending to the second
paragraph:

      At the end of each week, the person (if any) who held each
      office for the entire week gains two VCs.

[Fines are encouraged in cases where officeholders don't do their
duties, but I'd rather not make it platonic.  I was thinking of doing
a salary switch, but I don't think it would be awfully useful.]
