Amend Rule 1607 by replacing "Distributed proposals have ID numbers"
with "Proposals have ID numbers".

[No reason not to give non-distributed proposals numbers (at least now
that 'proposal' is defined as something submitted as one, rather than
a document which could potentially be submitted as one, as in the
past); they're already part of the Promotor's report.]
