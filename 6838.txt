Amend Rule 2293 "Leadership Tokens" by replacing:

       A player CAN redeem 3 Leadership Tokens in eir possession to
       satisfy the Winning Condition of Leadership.

with:

       If a player possesses at least 3 Leadership Tokens, e CAN redeem
       all Leadership Tokens in eir possession to satisfy the Winning
       Condition of Leadership.

[If a player uses a scam to possess *many* Leadership Tokens, e should
not win 100 times, should e? You think, this will never happen? It could
already have happened, if I had been clever enough.]
