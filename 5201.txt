Murphy is a coauthor of this proposal.

Amend Rule 2125 (Regulation Regulations) to read:

       An action is regulated if any of the following is true:

         (a) The rules specify that the action CANNOT be performed, or
             CAN be performed ONLY IF certain conditions are satisfied.

         (b) The rules specify that the action MAY NOT be performed, or
             MAY be performed ONLY IF certain conditions are satisfied.

         (c) The action would, as part of its effect, modify information
             that some player SHALL record.  Any such action CANNOT be
             performed except as allowed by the rules.

         (d) The action would, as part of its effect, make it IMPOSSIBLE
             to make arbitrary modifications to the rules by any
             combinations of actions by players, and/or IMPOSSIBLE to
             adopt proposals within a four-week period.  Any such action
             CANNOT be performed.

         (e) The courts have held that the action is regulated, and this
             finding has not been overturned.  Any specification by this
             finding that the action is IMPOSSIBLE and/or ILLEGAL in some
             or all circumstances remains in effect until the rules are
             amended to the contrary.

[Specify which things are IMPOSSIBLE and which are ILLEGAL.]

Repeal Rule 1698 (The Proposal System Is Protected).

[Merged into Rule 2125.]
