Amend Rule 107 by replacing the text reading:

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  By default, the voting period lasts
      for seven days.  This rule takes precedence over any rule which
      would require a voting period for some decision to be shorter
      than seven days, unless the decision is whether to approve a
      dependent action.

with:

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  By default, the voting period lasts
      for seven days.  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
      voting period for a decision cannot be shorter than seven days,
      unless the decision is whether to approve a dependent action.
