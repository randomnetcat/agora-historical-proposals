Amend Rule 1950 (Decisions with Adoption Indices) by deleting "first-class".

Enact a new power-2 rule entitled "Partisan Actions" reading:
      The constitution of a party CAN authorize one or more of its
members to, by
      announcement, cause that party to take any action it CAN take, subject
      to any limitations set out in that constitution. In the absence of such a
      provision, the Leader of a party CAN cause that party to act with support
      from a majority of the other members of the party.
