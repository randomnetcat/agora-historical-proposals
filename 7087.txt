Amend Rule 2333 (Contests) by replacing:

     The contest's instructions should include conditions under which
     one or more persons win the contest. When one or more persons
     win a contest, those persons satisfy the Victory Condition of
     Victory.

with:

     The contest's instructions should include conditions under which
     persons "win the contest".  Upon an announcement by the
     contestmaster that one or more persons satisfy those conditions,
     all those persons satisfy the Victory Condition of Victory.
     Intentionally making a false such announcement is the Class-4
     Crime of Gaming the System.

[This just restores the old language about the contestmaster making an
announcement, which I think fits much better with the spirit of the
rule than scshunt's platonic version.]
