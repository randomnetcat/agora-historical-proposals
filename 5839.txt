 [INNOCENT isn't really a criminal concept, nor are the others.  All
 that matters is guilty or not guilty, the rest is for the arguments].

Amend R1504 by replacing:
     * GUILTY, appropriate if the defendant breached the specified
       rule via the specified act and none of the above judgements is
       appropriate
with:
     * GUILTY, appropriate if the judge finds, beyond a reasonable
       doubt, that ALL of the following are true:
       (a) the defendant breached the specified rule via the specified
           act;
       (b) the breach occurred within 200 days prior to the case being
           initiated;
       (c) judgement has not already been reached in another criminal
           case with the same defendant, the same rule, and substantially
           the same alleged act;
       (d) the defendant could not have reasonably believed that the
           alleged act did not violate the specified rule;
       (e) the defendant could have reasonably avoided committing the
           breach without committing a different breach of equal or
           greater severity.

     * NOT GUILTY, appropriate if GUILTY is not appropriate.  In
       delivering this verdict, the judge SHOULD indicate which of
       of the sub-requirements for a finding of guilty were not found
       to be true beyond a reasonable doubt.
