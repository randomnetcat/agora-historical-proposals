     3. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED:  Performing the

     7. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Failing to perform
        the described action without having and providing a very,
        very good reason for failure is not considered to be in

Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing:
       that the correlation between the fine and the severity of the
       breach is appropriate, or to account for the faith (good or
       bad) shown by the Ninny in contesting the notice or in aiding
       or obstructing the course of justice.
with:
       that the correlation between the fine and the severity of the
       breach is appropriate, or to account for the faith (good or
       bad) shown by the Ninny in contesting the notice, in aiding
       or obstructing the course of justice, or in acting for or
       against the best interests of the game.

[Puts SHOULD squarely into the realm of the inquiry courts and
other such interpretative situations [R217], keeps it out of
criminality, although it could be used as a criteria for sentencing
if a SHOULD also breaks a SHALL].
