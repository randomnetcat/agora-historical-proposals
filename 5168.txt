Amend rule 2126 by appending to the list of ways that VCs can be
gained (and lost, if both are in a single list) the new item

      (+W) When a first-class person becomes a player and has never
           been a player before, e gains one white VC.  When a
           first-class person has been a player continuously for 100
           days and has never been a player before that period, e
           gains one white VC.

[Long ago there was a currency award to new players.  This version of
the newbie award has a couple of twists to make it interesting.  The
immediate registration award, being only a single VC, can't be used
for anything on its own, even to transfer to another player, so
spamming registrations can't be used to inject lots of VCs into the
economy.  White VCs can't be gained any other way, so they're valuable
to a long-term player as a rare color, especially if we add ways to
spend (say) six color together in the future, so there's a tension
created between using the VC immediately and saving it up.  Finally,
the 100-day bonus is not only an incentive to keep playing, it also
opens up the possibility of transferring a white VC to another player
who's collecting color, but only if the new player kept eir first
white VC.  Incentive to enter into contracts early.]

Change the color of all gray VCs to white.

[If Murphy's colorising proposal passes and no one transfers gray VCs
away from the partnerships first, the only gray VC in the game will be
Manu's.  Its origin as a gratuitous VC back when VCs were invented
makes this an appropriate translation.]
