Amend Rule 2166 (Assets) by replacing "instrument" with "rule", and by
replacing this text:

     The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity defined as
     such by its backing document.

with this text:

     The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
     defined as such by, and bound by, its backing document.

Amend Rule 2181 (The Accountor) to read:

     The Accountor is a low-priority office; its holder is responsible
     for keeping track of classes of assets.

     The Accountor's report includes a list of all classes of assets,
     and their backing documents and recordkeepors.
