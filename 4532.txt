Title: Removing Oligarchs From the Oligarchy
Power = 2

      When the Rules direct the GWotO to remove a Player from the
      Oligarchy, the GWotO shall publicly announce:

      (i) the Oligarch to be removed;
      (ii) the reason for the removal; and
      (iii) the Rule that authorizes that reason.

      If this notice is correct, the named Player ceases to be an
      Oligarch as of the GWotO's announcement.

      The GWotO's announcement is to be made as soon as possible
      after the governing event happens, unless the governing Rule
      specifies a different time period.

Amend R1936 by replacing:

      (b) If an Oligarch becomes ineligible to be an Oligarch, the
          GWotO shall remove that Player from the Oligarchy as soon as
          possible.  The GWotO removes a Player from the Oligarchy by
          correctly announcing that at least one of the above
          conditions is true for that Player.  The named Player ceases
          to be an Oligarch as of the GWoTO's announcement.

With:

      (b) If an Oligarch becomes ineligible to be an Oligarch, the
          GWotO shall remove that Player from the Oligarchy.


Amend R1963 by replacing:

      (b) By default, a Player remains an Oligarch for a period of
          time equal to the Oligarchic Term.  The Grand Warden of the
          Oligarchy shall remove a Player from the Oligarchy by public
          announcement, as soon as possible after eir term expires.
          Other rules may cause Players to cease to be Oligarchs.

with:

      (b) When a Player's Term of Service expires, the Grand Warden of
          the Oligarchy shall remove that Player from the Oligarchy.
