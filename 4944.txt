Amend rule 101 by deleting the words "besides the Speaker".

Retitle rule 103 to "Exactly One Speaker".

Amend rule 103 to read:

      There should always be exactly one player who is the Speaker.
      No one other than a player can be Speaker, and there can never be
      more than one Speaker.  If there is ever no Speaker then the  
player
      whose most recent registration was earliest becomes the Speaker.

[A Speaker leaving the game is not the disaster that it used to be.
I see no justification for continuing to deny the Speaker eir civil  
right
to leave the game.  Speakership passing to the most senior player was
something I previously put into R786/6 back in 1997 and which stayed in
that rule until 2005.]
