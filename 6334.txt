Amend Rule 911 (Appeal Cases) by deleting:
                 If the time period ends with no majority judgement,
      the panel acts to deliver a judgement of REMAND.

 Amend Rule 911 (Appeal Cases) by inserting the following new
 paragraphs immediately after the paragraph in which the above
 deletion occurred:

      If the time period ends with no majority judgement, then:
      - if the Justiciar has published an opinion on the case
        clearly marked as the Justiciar's Opinion and indicating
        a valid judgement, and that judgement is the same as
        one given by at least one panel member (other than the
        Justiciar), then the panel delivers that judgement;

      - otherwise, the case enters an overtime period, which
        lasts for four days.  The CotC SHOULD publicly remind the
        Justiciar when an overtime period begins.  During
        this period, if the  Justiciar publishes a Justiciar's
        Opinion that is the same as one panel member's as
        described above, then the panel delivers that judgement;

      - otherwise, the CotC CAN and SHALL, asap after the
        overtime period ends, act for the panel by announcement
        to deliver a judgement of either REMAND or REASSIGN,
        whichever e feels is most appropriate.


Amend Rule 2019 (Prerogatives) by replacing the paragraph
that begins with "b) Justiciar" with the following paragraph:

      b) Justiciar.  The Justiciar may be granted particular
      abilities or privileges associated with the judicial
      process as described elsewhere in the Rules.

 [The Justiciar can just submit an opinion when e feels like it,
 and it's used as the tiebreaker when needed].
