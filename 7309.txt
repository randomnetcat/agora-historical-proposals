      Optionally, the author CAN, in the creating message, specify one
      or more conditions required to be true for the promise to be
      cashed, and/or one or more conditions required to be true for
      the promise not to be destroyed when cashed.
with:
      Optionally, the author CAN, in the creating message specify one
      or more of the following:

         a) a title
         b) one or more conditions required to be true for the promise
            to be cashed;
         c) one or more conditions required to be true for the promise
            not to be destroyed when cashed; and
         d) one or more conditions under which the author of the promise
            can destroy it.
and by appending:
      If a promise has one or more conditions under which the author of
      the promise can destroy it, and they are all satisfied, then the author
      CAN destroy that promise with notice.
