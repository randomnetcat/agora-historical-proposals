Change the power of Rule 2354 (Costs) to 3, and amend it by replacing:

     The documents defining the conditions for performing an action
     can specify another action as a cost; paying the cost becomes a
     condition for performing the original action.

with:

     A document defining an action as a cost for another action
     thereby defines paying the cost as a condition to successfully
     perform the latter action.
