Amend Rule 911 by replacing this text:

      * REMAND, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement but the judge believes
        that the judge of the prior case can make a better judgement
        if given a new opportunity; the prior question is rendered
        open again

      * REASSIGN, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement; the judge of the prior
        case (if any) is recused, and the prior question is rendered
        open again

with this text:

      * REMAND, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement; the prior question
        is rendered open again; this judgement SHOULD be assigned
        if the judge believes that the judge of the prior case will
        make a better judgement if given a new opportunity

      * REASSIGN, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement; the judge of the prior
        case (if any) is recused, and the prior question is rendered
        open again; this judgement SHOULD be assigned if the judge
        believes that the judge of the prior case will not make a
        better judgement if given a new opportunity
