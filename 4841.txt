Proposal:  Order categorical

Repeal Rule 1048 (Rule Categories).

Amend Rule 1681 by replacing the text:

              All existing categories must be listed, even if no
      rules are currently assigned to the category.

with the following new paragraph:

      A new Rule is assigned to a category as the Rulekeepor sees fit.
      The Rulekeepor may, without 2 objections, move Rules between
      categories, change the name of a category, and add or remove
      empty categories.
