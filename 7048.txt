Create a new Rule, entitled "War," with the following text:

Hostility is a switch for subsets of players of size 2 tracked by the
Scorekeepor, with values peace (default) and war. Any player CAN, with
notice, declare war on any other player. Any player CAN make peace
with any other player with that player's Support. Whenever points are
created in a player's possession (but not when the rules describe
points as being recreated), a number of points equal to the number of
points e just gained divided by the number of players e is at war
with, rounded down, are destroyed in the possession of each player e
is at war with. Whenever a player's point total reaches zero by this
method e CANNOT become at war with any other player for 21 days the
rest of this rule notwithstanding, e CANNOT gain any points for 14
days rules to the contrary notwithstanding, and then finally, one
moment after eir score became zero, e becomes at peace with all other
players.
