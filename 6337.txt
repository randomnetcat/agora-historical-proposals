     Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the only appropriate
     sentence for a rule violation prior to the adoption of this rule is

Amend the first paragraph of Rule 1504 to read:
(
     Criminal cases are a subclass of judicial cases.  Any
     first-class person can initiate a criminal case by an
     announcement calling for judgement on the circumstances
     surrounding an alleged rules breach by a single entity (the
     Accused).  The initiator and each member of the Accused's
     basis are unqualified to be assigned as judge of the case.
)
Amend bullet point c) rule 1504 to read:
(
      (c) judgement has not already been reached in another criminal
          case with the same Accused, the same rule, and substantially

       the breached Rule, rounded to the nearest integer with ties
       broken by rounding up, are created in the possession of the
       Ninny.  The judge CAN, with 2 Support, set the fine at a
       different integral level between one half and double that
       amount, and SHOULD attempt to do so if necessary to ensure
       that the correlation between the fine and the severity of the
       breach is appropriate.
