Amend Rule 2230 (Notices of Violation) by replacing this text:

     As soon as possible after a player makes an announcement that is
     reasonably recognizable as an attempt to issue such a notice,
     the Clerk of the Courts SHALL announce whether the Notice was
     valid. Such a Clerk of the Court's announcement is
     self-ratifying.  Affirming the validity of the notice does not
     in itself certify the correctness of the allegation.
