Create a power-1 rule, titled "Acidic Transactions", with the following text:

A transaction is a sequence of events defined as such by the rules. A
sequence of events that takes place "atomically" is a transaction. A
transaction can include another transaction as one of its steps; apart
from this, transactions always occur sequentially, never
simultaneously. If any part of a transaction fails to take effect, the
entire transaction fails to take effect. If a transaction would span
any length of time, it instead fails.

If a person CAN perform a sequence of events by announcement, then
they CAN perform the sequence of events atomically by announcement.
