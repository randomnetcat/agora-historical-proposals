      which occurs automatically occurs, the Herald shall publicly
      announce that such an award or revocation has occurred, and
      which Title has been awarded to or revoked from which person or
      persons.

to read:

      As soon as possible after the Rules state that a Patent title
      shall be awarded or revoked, the Herald shall publicly award or
      revoke that Patent Title.

Amend Rule 1044 (Unique Patent Titles) to read:

      A Patent Title is unique when the rules say it is.  If a person

      it as soon as possible from any person already Bearing that
      Title.

      The following are Unique Patent Titles:

      (a)  Robespierre, which shall be awarded to the Player who called
           for a Revolt, if the Revolt succeeds.

      (b)  Miscreant, which shall be awarded to a Player who has at
           least ten Blots and has a greater number of Blots than any
           other Player, if there is such a Player.  It shall
           automatically be revoked if either condition becomes false.

      (c)  Pugachev, which shall be awarded to the player who called
           for a Revolt, if the Revolt fails.

      (d)  Manouchian, which shall be awarded to the player who called
           for a Revolt and deregistered before the Registrar
           announced that the Revolt succeeded.
