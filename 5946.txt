Author: Murphy
Co-authors: 
Adoption index: 3.0

Amend Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) by appending this text:

     If a proposal took effect within the past week, but one of its
     attempted changes to the gamestate was ineffective solely due to
     insufficient power, and the proposal would still have been adopted
     if its adoption index had been the minimum power required for that
     change to have been effective, then any player CAN repair the
     proposal by announcement that clearly identifies the proposal,
     the ineffective change, and the minimum power.  Upon such an
     announcement, the change takes effect.
