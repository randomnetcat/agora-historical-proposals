Amend Rule 2199 by replacing the text before the list of Ribbons with
        Ribbons are a class of fixed assets.  If winning is secured,
        then changes to Ribbon holdings are secured with the same power
        threshold.  Ownership of Ribbons is restricted to players.

        Each Ribbon has exactly one color.  Colors with different names
        are distinct, regardless of spectral proximity.  Each color of
        Ribbon is a currency. The Herald is the recordkeepor of Ribbons.

        While a player qualifies for a Ribbon, any person CAN, by
        announcement, award that player a Ribbon of that color, unless
        e already possesses one.

        When a player earns a Ribbon, e thereafter qualifies for that
        Ribbon until the opportunity expires, which occurs either when it
        is used or at the time limit, which defaults to one week. An
        opportunity is used when a player is awarded a Ribbon of that
        colour, e does not qualify for that Ribbon except through earned
        opportunities, and the opportunity is the one that will expire
        first. In case of a tie, only one of the opportunities tied for
        shortest duration is used.
