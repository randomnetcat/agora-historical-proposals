Proposal:  Graft be ... gone?

[Now that bonus clauses are no longer illegal, Grafty can be moved to
a cardbook without worrying about illegality.]

Add the following Card Element to the Twopower Cardbook:

        Grafty: If a card is Grafty, then its initial quota is set
        equal to one plus the number of Players who voted FOR the
        Proposal that first defined that class of card as Grafty.
        When the Deckmastor initially creates cards to fulfil this
        quota, e shall first destroy all existing copies of the card,
        then create one copy in the possession of the Deck, and
        finally create one copy in the possession of each Player who
        voted FOR said proposal.
