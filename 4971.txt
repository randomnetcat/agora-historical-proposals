Amend Rule 1023 (Common Definitions) by appending this text:

      (f) The term "person" shall mean "natural person or
          partnership of natural persons".

Create a rule titled "Limited Partnerships" with this text:

      If a partnership contains exactly the same members as
      another registered partnership, then it is prohibited
      from registering.

      If a registered partnership's membership changes such
      that it contains exactly the same members as another
      registered partnership, then it is deregistered.
