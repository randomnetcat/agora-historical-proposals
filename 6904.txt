Create a new Rule, titled "Deciphering the Book of Wmbredd o Gwag"

      Whenever a Player's Proposal is Rejected, and e has had no other
      proposal previously Rejected that Week, e is obliged to decipher
      the next line of Book of Wmbredd o Gwag (Book).

      Within 3 days of being so obliged, e must post a single sentence
      of no more than 30 words to be added to the Book.  Upon doing
      to, this text is appended to the text of the Book.  Players are
      permitted to ridicule additions (and their authors) that are non
      sequitur, and such ridiculed authors receive and hold the title
      of 'Fuzzy Duck' until someone else receives that title.

Set the text of the Book of Wmbredd o Gwag to the empty string.
