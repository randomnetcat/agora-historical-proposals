Amend Rule 2166 (Assets) by replacing each instance of "Bank" with
"Lost and Found Department", and by replacing this text:

                          and is destroyed if it is owned by an entity
      outside that class.

with this text:

                          and is destroyed if it is owned by an entity
      outside that class (except for the Lost and Found Department, in
      which case any player CAN transfer or destroy it without
      objection).
