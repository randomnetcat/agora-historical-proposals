Create a new, power=3, rule entitled "Official Holidays" with the
following text:
"
The following are Agoran Holiday's as defined by R1769:

(a) Winter Break -
The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin
      after 2 January.
"

Remove the final Paragraph from R1769

[I would also like to do an unofficial holiday's section.  This would
include read-the-ruleset week and agora's birthday, though I feel like
there would be great opposition to modifying the birthday rule]
