Amend rule 2156 by replacing the text "The BVLOP of a first-class
player is four, and the BVLOP of any other player is zero." with "The
BVLOP of a player is zero."

Amend rule 2126 by replacing the last sentence with:
"When one or more players win the game, each player's VVLOP is set to
eir BVLOP, and each player with more than four VCs loses all but four
VCs of their choice. A player who is to lose VCs in this way SHALL
indicate eir choice by announcement as soon as possible, and CANNOT
spend VCs until e does so.
If, after the aforementioned win but before the announcement of eir
choice, the player in question would lose VCs by any mechanism other
than this paragraph, then the loss is delayed until one second after
the VC loss required by this paragraph takes place."
