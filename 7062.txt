[Winning is winning, dammit.  If it were up to me it would set others'
points to zero like we did most other times we had points.  This is a
compromise on that idea vs. the current system.]

Amend Rule 2332 (Winning by Points) by appending the following paragraph:

    When a player satisfies the Victory Condition of Accumulation,
    half of every other player's points (rounded down) are destroyed.
