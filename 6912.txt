Adoption index: 1.0

If Murphy's proposal "Fear cleanup" has been adopted, then amend
Rule 2309 (The Propose-O-matic) by replacing sections 1 and 2 with
this text:

         1) Randomly select two rules.

         2) Submit a proposal whose effect is limited to repealing one
            of the selected rules (and, if necessary, making a minimal
            set of other rule changes so that the game would not be
            broken by the repeal), and another proposal whose effect is
            limited to amending the other selected rule.  Each of these
            proposals must be disinterested, with AI equal to the rule's
            power, and must note the rule's title.
