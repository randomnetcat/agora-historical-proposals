     In Rule 2154, in the second paragraph, replace:
            this process is known
            as an election.
     with
            this process is known
            as an election; (c) if there are no consenting nominees and
            the office is vacant, the IADOP SHALL, as soon as possible,
            resolve the nomination as Failed by announcement and begin
            a new nomination period by nominating at least one
            player to hold the office.

     and at the end of the third paragraph, insert:
            If at any time during an election there remains only one
            valid option, the election stops and the IADOP SHALL
            install the remaining candidate in the office by 
            announcement.
