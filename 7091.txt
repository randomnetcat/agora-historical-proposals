Create a new Power-2 Rule:

     Point Vouchers are a class of assets tracked by the Scorekeepor;
     multiple Point Vouchers with the same creation date are
     fungible.  A player CAN, as a Spending Action with a cost of one
     point, create a Point Voucher in eir possession.  At the start
     of the second Agoran week after a Point Voucher is created, its
     current owner gains one point and the Voucher is destroyed.

If Rule 2349 does not define Spending Actions, amend that rule by
replacing "as a Spending Action with" with "for"

[Suppose I create a lottery where everyone transfers me points, and I
award the lot to a random participant; but in the process I get over
250 points and someone makes me win.  This mechanism works around that
without making it too easy to hoard points.]
