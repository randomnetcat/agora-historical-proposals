Amend Rule 106 by inserting the following text after the second
paragraph:

     A player specifically permitted by the Rules to distribute
     a Proposal CAN distribute the proposal by publishing it
     with the clear intent of distributing it.  When a proposal is
     distributed, it is removed from the Proposal Pool.  The
     distribution of a proposal initiates the Agoran decision of
     whether to adopt the proposal, as described elsewhere.
     Removing a proposal from the Pool by a means other than
     initiating an Agoran Decision to adopt it is secured.

     If the Rules do not otherwise permit at least one current
     active player to distribute a Proposal, than any player may
     do so Without 3 Objections.


Amend Rule 1607 by deleting the third paragraph.

Amend Rule 1607 by replacing 'MAY' with 'CAN and MAY'.
