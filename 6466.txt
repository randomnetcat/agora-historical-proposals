In rule 2161 (ID Numbers), remove the entry with the bullet (c) and
reletter each subsequent bullet with the previous letter of the
alphabet. Then remove the word "orderly" wherever else it occurs in the
rule.
[It is no longer possible to illegally assign an ID Number; to my
knowledge there exist no chaotic numbers]
