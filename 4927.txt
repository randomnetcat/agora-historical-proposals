Amend the rule titled "Rule Changes" (which was numbered 2131 when
first enacted, and then renumbered to 105) by replacing each instance
of "a proposal" or "a Proposal" with "an instrument" and replacing
each instance of "A proposal" or "A Proposal" with "An instrument".
In performing this amendment, the case of characters is significant, and
the casing given in the preceding sentence is to be interpreted  
strictly;
the case of the word "a" is to be preserved in the replacement word  
"an".
