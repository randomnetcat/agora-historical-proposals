[No defined way to win other than paradox right now.  Let's
start playing again, most general way: contests].

[This first part is in case Sherlock wants an early out, also adds  
"inactive Speaker" protection.  Not intended to be a dig
at
Sherlock.]

Amend Rule 402 by appending the following text:

     If no cardinal has become a pope in the past six months, or
     a judge finds that the current Speaker has been inactive,
     inattentive, unwilling, or unable to perform eir Agoran
     duties, then a cardinal may be named a pope (and therefore
     Speaker as above) by Agoran Consent.  This is not considered
     winning.

Create the following Rule, entitled "Winning":

     The current Speaker may, with two supporters, invite
     players to enter into a specified agreement (hereafter a
     Contest) to determine who wins the game.  The contest
     must be open to all players.  Winners determined by the
     procedures of the contest do in fact win the game.  When
     the initiating Speaker ceases to be Speaker, the contest
     loses the legal authority to determine winners.

Amend rule 1922 by appending the following text:

     (d) Champion, to be awarded to players who win the game.
