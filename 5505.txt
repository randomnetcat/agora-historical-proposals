      The initiation of a criminal case begins its pre-trial phase.  If
      the plaintiff and defendant are the same first-class person, then
      the pre-trial phase ends immediately.  Otherwise, the CotC SHALL
      as soon as possible inform the defendant of the case and invite em
      to rebut the argument for eir guilt; the pre-trial phase ends one
      week after the defendant has been so informed.  At any time during
      the pre-trial phase, the defendant CAN end the pre-trial phase by
      announcement.
