Amend rule 2034 to read:

     Any proposal that would otherwise change the validity of any
     existing vote on any specific unresolved Agoran decision is
     wholly without effect, Monsters to the contrary notwithstanding.
     This does not prevent amendment of the Monsters governing the
     validity of votes on Agoran decisions in general.

     Once an Agoran decision has been resolved, votes on it CANNOT be
     validly submitted or retracted, and its outcome CANNOT be
     changed in any way, Monsters to the contrary notwithstanding.  This
     does not prevent correcting errors in reporting its resolution.

     A public document purporting to resolve an Agoran decision is
     self-ratifying.
