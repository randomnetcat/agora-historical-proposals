Amend Rule 1742 (Contracts) by replacing this text:

      A contract automatically terminates if the number of parties to
      it falls below the number of parties the rules require for the
      contract.  If other rules do not specify such a number for a
      contract, then a contract requires at least two parties.

with this text:

      A contract automatically terminates if the number of parties to
      it falls below the number of parties the rules require for the
      contract (two if not otherwise specified by the rules).

Amend Rule 2197 (Defining Contract Changes) to read:

      The following are Contract Changes:

        a) Becoming a party to a contract.
        b) Ceasing to be a party to a contract.
        c) Amending a contract.
        d) Terminating a contract.

Amend Rule 2198 (Making Contract Changes) to read:

      Contract Changes CAN be performed as follows:

        a) Using a mechanism by which the contract specifies that they
           CAN be performed.

        b) A person CAN become a party to a contract by announcement,
           unless the contract regulates becoming a party to it.

        c) By agreement between all parties to the contract, if the
           minimum number of parties for it is at least two.

        d) By a party without objection, if the minimum number of
           parties for it is less than two.

      The above notwithstanding, a Contract Change is INVALID if:

        a) It would make a person a party to a contract against their
           will.

        b) It is ambiguous.

        c) Its permissibility cannot be determined with certainty
           when it is attempted.
