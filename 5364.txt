Amend Rule 1727 (Happy Birthday) by appending this text:

      BE IT FURTHERMORE RESOLVED that Agora's Unbirthday is defined to
      be the entire day of December 30, GMT +1200, of each year; but,
      since that falls within a Holiday, is observed during the entire
      days of January 12 through 14, GMT +1200, of each year.

Amend Rule 2176 (Marks) by appending this text to the list of ways to
gain and lose Marks:

      (+m) When, during the observance of Agora's unbirthday, a player
           publicly acknowledges the occasion, e gains 2N+1 magenta
           Marks (where N is Agora's age rounded down to the nearest
           integer), unless e previously gained Marks in this manner
           during the same unbirthday.
