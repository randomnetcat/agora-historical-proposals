Amend Rule 2166 (Assets) to read:

      An asset is an entity defined as such by an instrument or
      contract (hereafter its backing document).

      Each asset has exactly one owner.  If an asset would otherwise
      lack an owner, it is owned by the Bank.  If an asset's backing
      document restricts its ownership to a class of entities, then
      that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred to an entity
      outside that class, and is destroyed if it is owned by an entity
      outside that class.

      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity defined as
      such by its backing document.  That entity's report includes a
      list of all instances of that class and their owners.  This
      portion of that entity's report is self-ratifying.

      An asset generally CAN be created by its recordkeepor by
      announcement, subject to modification by its backing
      document.  To "gain" an asset is to have it created in one's
      possession; to "award" an asset to an entity is to create it
      in that entity's possession.

      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by announcement,
      and an asset owned by the Bank generally CAN be destroyed by its
      recordkeepor by announcement, subject to modification by its
      backing document.  To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed
      from one's possession; to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to
      destroy it from that entity's possession.

      A asset generally CAN be transferred by its owner to another
      entity by announcement, subject to modification by its backing
      document.  A fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing
      document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is liquid.

      A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
      document.  Instances of a currency with the same owner are
      fungible.
