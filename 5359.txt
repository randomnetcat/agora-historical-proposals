Amend Rule 911 (Appeal Cases) by appending this text:

      A panel CAN publish a concurring opinion when judging AFFIRM,
      and SHALL do so if and only if the reasoning by which the prior
      judge reached eir judgement was incorrect in whole or part.  Each
      concurring opinion SHALL explain the nature of the error(s) in
      the prior judge's reasoning.  Each concurring opinion has an error
      rating, an integer from 1 to 99; it CAN be specified by the panel
      when the concurring opinion is published, or else defaults to 50.

and by replacing "of the of the" with "of the".

Amend Rule 2176 (Marks) by lower-casing all section labels, and by
appending this text to section (-b):

      When a concurring opinion is published, the prior judge loses a
      number of Blue Marks equal to its error rating.
