Create a new power-3 rule with the following text:
{{{
A rule whose most recent Rule Change was by proposal is known as a
Stable Rule.

A rule whose most recent Rule Change was due to the rule amending
itself, but where such a change was caused by a rule other than the rule
itself, is known as a Brittle Rule. Any player can cause a Brittle Rule
to repeal itself with 2.0 Agoran Consent.

A rule whose most recent Rule Change was due to the rule amending
itself, and where such a change was caused by the rule itself, is known
as a Shattered Rule. Any player can cause a Shattered Rule to repeal
itself with 1.2 Agoran Consent.

A rule which is not Stable, Brittle, or Shattered, is Strange. Upon a
win announcement that a given rule is Strange, nothing particularly
interesting happens.
