[Some of these rewards for adopted proposals are getting out of hand.]

Amend the rule titled "The Assessor's Boon Duties" by
replacing the text reading:

         * If a Proposal passes, and that Proposal was submitted by a
           Player within that Player's Grace Period, then the Assessor
           shall award the Proposor the Boon of Prodigy.

with:

         * If a Proposal passes, and that Proposal was submitted by a
           Player within that Player's Grace Period, then the Assessor
           shall award the Proposor the Boon of Prodigy, unless the
           Proposor has already received five or more such awards.


Amend rule 2080 to read:

      If a Proposal is adopted, the Proposer may draw from the deck by
      announcing the Proposal number while drawing; so long as the
      Proposer's Hand Size is smaller than the Maximum Hand Size plus
      the number of Offices e holds, the Proposer performs the draw
      within a week after the proposal's adoption, and the Proposer
      has not already done so for the same proposal.
