Amend rule 649 by appending to the first paragraph the sentence

      The herald is an office; its holder is responsible for tracking
      patent titles.

Repeal rule 1377.

[Rule 1377 has very little content.  As patent title's are the
herald's primary responsibility, the office may as well be defined
where patent titles are.]
