Amend rule 2158 by replacing the sentence

      When a judicial question is applicable and open, and its case
      has a judge assigned to it, the judge CAN assign a valid
      judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL assign an appropriate
      judgement to it as soon as possible.

      When a judicial question is applicable and open, and its case
      has a judge assigned to it, the judge CAN assign a valid
      judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so as soon as
      possible.  A judge SHALL NOT assign an inappropriate judgement
      to any judicial question.

[Make inappropriate judgement immediately illegal, rather than the
illegality merely being failure to assign appropriate judgement in
time.  Removes the potential loophole of an inappropriate judgement
being appealed, the case remanded, and a new judgement assigned all
within the original judgement time limit.]
