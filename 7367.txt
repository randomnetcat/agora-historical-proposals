Enact a new rule with power 4, ID 0, title "Regeneration", and text:

      WHEREAS Agora has been mortally wounded by a constant lack of
      gameplay, WHEREAS there are many who believe that Agora should
      find a new direction, WHEREAS any good nomic undergoes periodic
      change, WHEREAS the current actors in Agora are getting tired of
      their roles, AND WHEREAS all good things must come to an end;

      BE IT HEREBY PROCLAIMED that Agora shall begin a phase of
      regeneration, wherein:

          1) any interested party, who must be eligible to be a
             player, may submit a Regeneration Proposal until exactly
             one week after this rule is enacted, a Regeneration
             Proposal being a new Ruleset fit to be the initial
             Ruleset of a nomic;
          2) a player shall publish a list of all valid Regeneration
             Proposals to an official forum, and thereupon voting
             shall begin;
          3) any player (who must have been a player at the opening of
             voting) may cast a ballot, being a linear ordering of the
             valid Regeneration Proposals, until exactly one week
             after the opening of voting;
          4) a player shall after the close of voting post to an
             official forum a list of all valid votes and determine
             the outcome per the method of the Alternative Vote, a tie
             being broken in favour of the first Regeneration Proposal
             to have been submitted;
          5) rule 1698 is repealed, Rule 105 is repealed, and every
             other rule is simultaneously repealed, save that this
             process will continue to its conclusion;
          6) the First Agora shall come to an end;
          7) the Ruleset of the selected Regeneration Proposal shall
             be enacted; and finally
          8) the Second Agora shall begin;

      BE IT FURTHER PROCLAIMED that this rule may not be altered or
      repealed in any manner except as it itself specifies, or by
      means of a proposal adopted with none opposed;

      BE IT FURTHER PROCLAIMED that all players throughout Agora's
      history are thanked for their time, their effort, their energy,
      their labour, their dedication, their honour, their
      perspicacity, their prowess, their distinction, their love,
      their care; their virtue, their strength, their dexterity, their
      constitution, their intelligence, their wisdom, their charisma,
      their fortitude, their reflexes, their will, their knowledge,
      their courage, their expertise, their perseverance, their
      perspicacity, their bloodymindedness, their cleverness, their
      pedantry, and most of all their ability to have a good time; and

      BE IT FINALLY PROCLAIMED that it was a good run.
