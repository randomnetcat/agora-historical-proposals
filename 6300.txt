Change the power of Rule 2136 (Contests) to 2.

[This fixes two bugs:  R2198 allows contestmaster to be flipped, and
secures the flipping of contract switches so that R2136 cannot allow
contestmaster to be flipped.]

Ratify the following document:  {

  The following contracts have the following contestmasters.  No other
  contracts are contests.

Amend Rule 2173 (The Notary) by appending this text:

      The Notary tracks all contract switches not assigned to
      another officer.

For each contract and each contract switch that previously failed to
be a switch because no officer was assigned to track it, flip it to the
value it would have had if the Notary had been assigned to track it.

[The C# scam is not fixed here, because it's not obvious how it
should be fixed.]
