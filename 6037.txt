[Multiple rapid contest-creation has been exploited.  This
change replaces the "only one contest per
contestmaster" with a slow-play limit, that allows more contests
per contestmaster but slows scams].

Amend Rule 2136 (Contests) by replacing:
      b) Doing so would cause a player to be contestmaster of more
         than one contest.
with:
      b) Doing so would cause a player to be contestmaster when a
         member of eir basis has already become a contestmaster
         within the past seven days.
