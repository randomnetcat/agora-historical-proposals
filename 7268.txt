 Amend Rule 1950 (Decisions with Adoption Indices) by replacing:
       with values Ordinary (default) and Democratic.
 with:
       with values Ordinary (default), Democratic, and Star.


 [Yes, this makes Star Chamber proposals have the same voting
 levels as Democratic proposals.  Can make other rules later.]


 Amend Rule 683 (Voting on Agoran Decisions) by replacing:
       An eligible voter on a particular Agoran decision submits a
       ballot to the vote collector by publishing a valid notice
       indicating which one of the available options e selects.  To be
       valid, the ballot must satisfy the following conditions:
 with:
       An eligible voter on a particular Agoran decision submits a
       ballot to the vote collector by either:

       (1) publishing a valid notice indicating which one of the
           available options e selects; or
       (2) if and only if the decision is in Star Chamber, sending
           such a notice to the vote collector using the means of
           contact tracked by the Registrar.

       To be valid, the ballot must satisfy the following conditions:

 [I.E. no voting to Discussion, or on IRC, etc.  Unless of course
 a Vote Collector makes that the official means of contacting em!
 Retractions must still be public; however they can probably be
 relatively secretive, e.g. "I retract the most recent vote I sent
 to the Assessor".]

 Amend Rule 683 (Voting on Agoran Decisions) by appending:

      If a decision is in the Star Chamber, then if its vote
      collector publicly or privately reveals the existence or
      value of a ballot submitted to em for that decision before
      the decision's voting period has ended, e commits the Class-6
      crime of Opening the Chamber Doors.  E MAY reveal the number
      of ballots received if the rules require (e.g. for announcing
      the extension or ending of a voting period).
