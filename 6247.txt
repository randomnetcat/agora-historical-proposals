Amend Rule 1922 (Defined Regular Patent Titles) by replacing the section
defining Minister Without Portfolio with this text:

     (e) Minister Without Portfolio, to be awarded by the Herald to any
         player who wins the game and does not already bear the title.
         If the number of persons bearing this title is greater than the
         number of Prerogatives defined by the rules, then this title is
         administratively revoked from the non-player (if any) who has
         held it the longest, or otherwise from the player who has held
         it the longest.
