Amend Rule 2127 (Conditional Votes) by replacing the first two
paragraphs with this text:

      If a vote on an Agoran decision is submitted conditionally
      (e.g. "FOR if <X> is true, otherwise AGAINST"), then the
      selected option is evaluated based on the value of the
      condition(s) at the end of the voting period, and is
      clearly specified if and only if the value of the condition(s)
      can be reasonably determined (without circularity or paradox)
      from information reasonably available during the voting period.
