Amend Rule 2170 (Who Am I?) by inserting, between these sentences:

      The Executor of a public message is the first-class person who
      sends it, or who most directly and immediately causes it to be
      sent.  The executor of an action performed by announcement is
      the executor of the announcement.

this text:

      (Upon a judicial finding that the Executor of a public message
      cannot otherwise be determined within reasonable effort, the
      judge SHALL as soon as possible publish a judicial declaration
      specifying the identity of that message's Executor.)
