Enact a rule titled "The Angry Mob", reading:

      As soon as possible after this rule is enacted, the Mad
      Scientist SHALL randomly choose an integer from 1 to the number
      of eligible voters on this proposal plus the number of distinct
      voters who voted FOR this proposal. If the chosen integer is
      less than or equal to the number of distinct voters who voted
      AGAINST this proposal, then Rules 2192 and 2193 are repealed.
      When an integer is so chosen, this rule repeals itself.
