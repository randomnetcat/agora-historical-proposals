Amend Rule 1023 (Common Definitions) by appending:

       (c) If a regulated value, or the value of a conditional, or
           a value otherwise required to determine the outcome of
           a regulated action, CANNOT be reasonably determined
           (without circularity or paradox) from information
           reasonably available, or if it alternates instantaneously
           and indefinitely between values, then the value is
           considered to be Indeterminate, otherwise it is
           Determinate.

[Note that many things can be naturally indeterminate to start out;
e.g. if a conditional vote depends on events that may happen later
in the voting period.  So the fixes below and future additions need
to specify the time at which the indeterminism is measured for legal
effect; e.g. at the end of the voting period, or when a promise is
cashed)].

Amend Rule 2127 (Conditional Votes) by replacing:
                                     and is clearly specified if and
       only if the value of the condition(s) can be reasonably
       determined (without circularity or paradox) from information
       reasonably available during the voting period.
with:
                                     and is clearly specified if and
       only if the value of the condition(s) is/are determinate at
       the end of the voting period.


Amend Rule 2162 (Switches) by appending:

       If an action or set of actions would cause the value of an
       instance of a switch to become indeterminate, the instance
       instead takes on its last determinate and possible value,
       if any, otherwise it takes on its default value.


Amend Rule 2338 (Cashing Promises) by replacing:
       for the promise to be cashed are true
with:
       for the promise to be cashed are true and determinate

and by replacing:
       and all such conditions are true
with:
       and all such conditions are true and determinate
