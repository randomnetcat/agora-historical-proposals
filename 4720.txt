Quota: 5
Elements: Handed[2]
Exploit:  For a fee of 1 kudo you may indicate any one card from the
deck, to be known as the 'Wish', and any one player, to be known as
the 'Fisherman', provided that the Fisherman is not currently
indicated by any other 'Fish your Wish' card.  If the Fisherman is
already indicated by another 'Fish your Wish' card then the playing of
the card is unsuccessful and this card does not leave the player's
hand.  If the Fisherman's next draw is the Wish you get the card from
them and get to draw one card for free. If the Fisherman's next draw
is not the Wish you may pay a fee of 1 Kudo to draw a card and if you
draw the Wish with this draw you get to draw a card for free.
