      Props are a currency.

      The Air Traffic Controller is an office and the recordkeepor of
      props.

      Ownership of Props is restricted to first-class Players. Props
      CANNOT be created, transferred, or destroyed except as allowed
      by this rule or required by the rules in general.

      possession.  When a player deregisters, eir props are destroyed.

      Once per week, each first-class player CAN transfer a prop from
      one entity to another, provided that e explains why e chose each
      entity, and does not transfer it to emself.

      At the beginning of each week, one prop in the possession of
      each entity possessing more than fourteen props is destroyed,
      and one prop is created in the possession of each first-class player
      possessing less than fourteen props.

      Entities with at least 19 props are Pilots; the Pilot with the
      most props (if any) is the Captain. Entities with less than 9
      props are Marines.
