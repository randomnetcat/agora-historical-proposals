Create a new Power-3 Rule reading:

       If a person CAN perform an action by announcement, e CAN perform
       it with N support, or without N objections, where N is a
       positive integer.

       If a person CAN perform an action with notice, e CAN perform it
       without N objections, where N is a positive integer.

       If a person CAN perform an action with M support, e CAN perform
       it with N support, where N is a positive integer greater than M.

       If a person CAN perform an action without M objections, e CAN
       perform it without N objections, where N is a positive integer
       less than M.

[Allow people to perform dependent actions with
stricter-than-necessary requirements declared in the notice of intent.
  You could already do this using Rule 1728 d), e.g. "I intend, with 2
support, if there are at least 3 supporters, to appeal this CFJ"; this
proposal simplifies that case to "I intend, with 3 support, to appeal
this CFJ".]
