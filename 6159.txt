Repeal the rule created by Proposal 6130 (Open It Up).

Amend Rule 2223 (Win by Junta) to read:

     When a rule comes to state that one or more persons CAN cause it
     to make arbitrary rule changes by announcement, all those
     persons satisfy the Winning Condition of Dictatorship.

     Cleanup procedure:  Those persons SHALL as soon as possible
     amend the rule so that it no longer states this, and SHOULD
     amend the rules to prevent this condition from being achieved
     again in essentially the same way.
