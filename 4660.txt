A new rule with power 2 shall be created, with the text:

      Upon the creation of this rule, all unsatisfied requirements to
      discard one or more cards that arose from from Rule 2075/1 or Rule
      2083/0 prior to March 19, 2005 are hereby voided and are deemed to
      have never existed.


The same rule shall then be repealed.


Rule 2074 shall be amended to read:

      Flux is a stuck switch for Gamblers with states Free and Frozen.
      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a Gambler with frozen
      flux may not play, discard, or transfer cards from eir hand, nor
      may the Deckmastor satisfy pending draws for that hand. However,
      the Deckmastor may by public announcement discard cards from
      any Frozen Gambler as required by the Rules.

      The Deck's flux shall always be free, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.
