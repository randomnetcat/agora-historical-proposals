Replace the following from Rule 1686

      Each officer with a Weekly Report must publish it weekly unless
      the content of the report would substantially be the same as in
      the previously published report. In this case, a report must
      only be published within one week of the next substantial change
      to the report's content. Each officer with a Monthly Report must
      publish it monthly.  Failure to do so is the Class 2 Infraction
      of Failure to Report.  If an officer fails to do so for at least
      three consecutive reporting periods, e may be cited for either
      Failure to Report or the Class 10 Infraction of Dereliction of
      Duty but not both.  Any officer cited for Dereliction of Duty is
      immediately removed from that office. The Assistant Director of
      Personnel and the Speaker may report these Infractions.
