PROPOSAL TEXT:
Repeal Rule 2271 (Ongoing Change).
Repeal Rule 2272 (Leadership Tokens).
Repeal Rule 2273 (Coups de Grace).

Amend Rule 2269 (Couple Coups) to read as follows:
       A coup is either a coup d'etat or a chicken coup.

       When a player begins a coup, the coup is a coup d'etat if it has
       been at least one month since any player last Formed the
       Government (if ever) and since the last coup d'etat (if ever) and
       if the player beginning the coup is not the Speaker, a chicken
       coup otherwise.

       The effects of the various varieties of coup are defined
       elsewhere in the rules.

Amend Rule 2270 (Coups D'etat) to read as follows:
       When a player begins a coup d'etat, an Emergency Session is
       called. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the roll call of
       this Emergency Session is the set of players who were Senators
       and not Ministers when the Emergency Session is called, plus the
       player who began the coup.

Amend Rule 2274 (Government) by appending "A member of the Government is
a Minister."
