Amend Rule 478 (Fora) by replacing this text:

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by announcing that
      e performs it.

with this text:

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously
      specifying the action and announcing that e performs it.

Repeal Rule 2208 (Clarity of Announcements).

[2208's precedence claim was really just overriding 478.  Any other
Power=3 rule attempting to allow ambiguity is presumably doing so as
part of a scam, in which case the scamsters can probably just increase
the offending rule's Power to 3.1 with little added difficulty.]
