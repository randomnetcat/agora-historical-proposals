Add the following text to the end of Rule 1870:

      There exists a Boon known as Shiny New Toy, and an Albatross known
      as Lump of Coal.  For the purposes of this rule, Players with a
      Stain of at least one Blot are known as Naughty, and Players with a
      Stain of less than one Blot are known as Nice.

      As soon as possible after the conclusion of the Holiday described
      above, the Herald shall award a Shiny New Toy to each Nice Player,
      and a Lump of Coal to each Naughty player.
