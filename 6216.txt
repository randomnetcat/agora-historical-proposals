Amend Rule 107 (Initiating Agoran Decisions) by appending this text:

       A decision is secret if and only if defined as such by rules
       with Power at least 2.  Votes on a secret decision are sent
       and retracted by sending a message to its vote collector
       instead of sending a public message, and these actions SHALL
       NOT be disclosed to anyone else during its voting period.

Create a rule titled "Secret Proposals" with Power 2 and this text:

       Once per week, a player CAN make one of eir proposals secret
       by announcement.  The decision on whether to adopt a secret
       proposal is secret.

[Includes generalized framework for secret officer elections as well,
with criteria TBD.]
