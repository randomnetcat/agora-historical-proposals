Amend Rule 2125 (Regulation Regulations) by appending to this text:

      c) The rules explicitly state that it CAN be performed while
         certain conditions are satisfied.  Such an action CANNOT be
         performed except as allowed by the rules.

this text:

         In particular, if the action in question is publishing a
         type of document, then a public message is not that type of
         document (even if it is labeled as such) except as allowed
         by the rules.

Amend Rule 2230 (Notices of Violation) by replacing "MAY publish" with
"CAN publish".
