Create a rule named "Schroedingor" with the following body:
---
Schroedingor is an office;  Its holder is responsible for the tracking
of Cats.

Schroedingor's weekly duties include the reporting of all Cats that
have had  a change in Liveliness since the last report and all Cats
and Kittens that currently have a Liveliness of Unknown.  It will also
contain a description of each Cat and what each Cat depeneds on.
---

Create a rule named "Schroedingor's Cats" with the following body:
---
A Cat is a point of ambiguity in the current state of Agora.  Any
player may indicate that a Cat exists.  A Cat must be a situation that
either happened, or did not, but the current state of the Cat is not
known at this time.

Cats have a switch called Liveliness which may either be Dead, Mostly
Dead, Unknown, Mostly Alive, or Alive, with a default of Unknown.  A
Dead cat did not happen, an Alive cat did happen, and Unknown cat has
not been looked at yet.

Schroedingor CAN flip a Cat's Liveliness to any value without objection.

Upon a judicial finding that a Cat occurred, Schrodingor SHALL ASAP
flip its Liveliness to Mostly Alive.  Upon the expiration of all
deadlines to appeal that finding, e SHALL ASAP flip the Cat's
Liveliness to Alive.

Upon a judicial finding that a Cat did not accour, Schrodingor SHALL
ASAP flip its Liveliness to Mostly Dead.  Upon the expiration of all
deadlines to appeal that finding, e SHALL ASAP flip the Cat's
Liveliness to Dead.

If a Cat's Liveliness is Unknown and an action has happened that
depends on that Cat being Dead or Alive, a new Cat, henceforth known
to as a Kitten is created.  Players SHOULD NOT create Kittens without
explicitly stating that a Kitten is being created.  Once a Cat becomes
Dead/Alive Schroedingor SHOULD resolve all Kittens dependent on that
Cat to the best of eir ability.
