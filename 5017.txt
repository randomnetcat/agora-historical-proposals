Repeal rule 1803.

Amend rule 1794 by appending to item (c) the sentence "A Judicial
Oredr is executed by announcement.".

[We don't need the complex execution mechanism: announcement will do
fine. The second paragraph of rule 1803 is vacuous, as it merely
describes a particular application of the Motion mechanism.]

Amend rule 1564 by replacing each instance of "Judicial or Sentencing
Order" with "Judicial Order".

Amend rule 1804 by replacing each instance of "Judicial Order or
Sentencing Order" with "Judicial Order".

[Sentencing Orders are a subclass of Judicial Orders.]
