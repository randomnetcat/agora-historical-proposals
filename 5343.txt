Adoption index: 1

Amend Rule 2134 (Voting Limits are Limited) to read:

      Upon a correct announcement that a single player's EVLOP is
      greater than the combined EVLOP of all other players, that
      player wins the game.

[Clarify which measure of VLOP is used.  Also change >= to >, as an
ordinary "I win the game" proposal would need >50% support to pass.]
