     * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
       true at the time the inquiry case was initiated

       undecidable or otherwise not capable of being accurately
       described as either false or true, at the time the inquiry
       case was initiated

     * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement at
       the time the inquiry case was initiated is not relevant to the
       game
