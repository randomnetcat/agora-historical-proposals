Amend Rule 478 (Fora) by adding, immediately after the paragraph
containing "Publicity is a forum switch", this text:

      The Registrar's report includes, for each forum with non-null
      publicity, sufficient instructions for players to receive
      messages there.

[Moved from Rule 2139.  Allows for additional values of publicity,
should we ever wish to define some.]

Amend Rule 2139 (The Registrar) to read:

      The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of players.

      The Registrar's report includes, for each player:

        a) Information sufficient to identify and contact em.
        b) The date on which e most recently became a player.

[No longer explicitly relies on nicknames and e-mail addresses.  For
instance, someone could set up a web bulletin board that mirrors the
fora, and some players could play Agora through that web forum.]
