[Before we start, let me please justify this.

Rule 101 is broken.

Firstly, we are on a game played via computers. Really, we have no
inherent rights at all. (I'm aware of the "society" view. I personally think
it's silly, but I can understand it. Even so, let's continue.)

Additionally, there isn't really that much reason to stop some of the
"rights" there being abridged - e.g. (iii), (vii). ALREADY TRIED is already
in the CFJ system, so it's kind of duplication (and any non-ALREADY
TRIED judgement for something already tried will probably be appealed
anyway.)

Finally, (vi). The distributor can ban someone from the lists. Yet, precedent
has it that when an action would "violate" Rule 101 it just doesn't happen.
Therefore, the person would be banned and unable to participate in the
fora, and yet (vi) says that no, that's impossible, they CAN participate in
them. It makes no sense.]

Add a rule titled "Our Helpful Assistant" (power=3.1):
[[Rule 101 CAN be repealed by a Proposal of power 3.1.]]

Repeal rule 101.

Repeal the rule titled "Our Helpful Assistant".
