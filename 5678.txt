In Rule 2170, "Who Am I?", insert the following paragraphs before the
last paragraph:

"A person can act on behalf of another person (the Absentee) to send a
message if and only if the Absentee consents to this. The Absentee
agreeing to a contract allowing persons to act on eir behalf is
considered consent, as is supporting or otherwise consenting to a
Contract Change amending a contract to allow persons to act on eir
behalf. This consent is automatically withdrawn if the contract is
terminated or ceases to allow persons to act on the Absentee's behalf.
The Absentee can manually withdraw eir consent at any time.

The above notwithstanding, if a partnership's text specifies a way for
persons to send a message on its behalf, persons CAN send such a
message that way.
