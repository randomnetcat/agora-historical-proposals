Amend R101(The Rights of Agorans) by replacing:
       iv. Every person has the right to not be considered bound by
           an agreement, or an amendment to an agreement, which e has
           not had the reasonable opportunity to review.

with:
       iv. Every person has the right to not be considered bound by
           an agreement, or an amendment to an agreement, or a Rule
           Change, which e has not had the reasonable opportunity to
           review.  For the purpose of protecting this right, a
           rule change which would otherwise take effect without its
           substance being subject to general player review through a
           reasonably public process is wholly prevented from taking
           effect.

[This would have blocked e.g. comex's "change the proposal text at the
last second" scam.  While that specific bug has been fixed, this
elevates the fix to prevent such scams generally (other past examples
included bugs that ended the voting period right after it started).

This also means that the scam goal text of "X can change the rules by
announcement" would no longer function, even if written into a power-3
rule.  Though "X can change the rules by giving 4 days notice" or
somesuch would probably suffice.  So if you get a power-3 scam, you'd
have to make a slightly cleverer power grab.

Historical note:  during the time period when the rules were
unarguably considered an agreement, this protection was there, so
it's not new.]
