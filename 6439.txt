In rule 2257, replace
      Whenever the rules indicate that a dealer SHALL deal a card to
      an entity, or that the entity "earns a draw" from a particular
      deck, that deck's dealer SHALL, as soon as possible, create a
      card in the possession of that entity, with the card chosen at
      random from among cards in that deck, with the probability of a
      particular card being chosen being the frequency of that card
      divided by the sum of the frequencies of all the cards in that
      deck (if this sum is zero, the requirement to deal asap is
      waived, and the dealer SHALL NOT deal a card from that deck
      until the sum is greater than zero).
