Amend Rule 2143 (Official Reports) to read:

      For each office:

        a) If any information is defined by the rules as part of
           that office's weekly report, then the holder of that
           office SHALL maintain all such information, and SHALL
           publish it at least once each week.  Otherwise, that
           office has no weekly report.

        b) If any information is defined by the rules as part of
           that office's monthly report, then the holder of that
           office SHALL maintain all such information, and SHALL
           publish it at least once each month.  Otherwise, that
           office has no monthly report.

      Any information defined by the rules as part of an office's
      report, without specifying which one, is part of its weekly
      report (unless the office is defined by the rules as
      low-priority, in which case it is part of its monthly report).

[Eliminate content-free "The rules may X" construction.  Allow offices
to be tagged as monthly-report-by-default, rather than having to
remember to do so for every element of their reports.]

Amend Rule 1006 (Offices) by removing the paragraph beginning "If the
duty of an office is to maintain certain information".

[Redundant with Rule 2143.  Doesn't really need Power=2 protection.]

Amend Rule 649 (Patent Titles) by replacing "The herald is an office"
with "The herald is a low-priority office", and by replacing "The
Herald's monthly report" with "The Herald's report".

Amend Rule 1922 (Defined Regular Patent Titles) by replacing "The
Herald's monthly report" with "The Herald's report".

Amend Rule 2148 (The Ambassador) by replacing "The ambassador is an
office" with "The ambassador is a low-priority office".

Amend Rule 2147 (Protectorates) by replacing "The ambassador's monthly
report" with "The ambassador's report".
