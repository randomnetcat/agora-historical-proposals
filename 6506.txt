If a Rule titled "Assumption of Vacant Offices" exists, then amend it by
replacing its entire text with the following {}-delimited text;
otherwise, create a new Power-2 rule, "Assumption of Vacant Offices",
with the following {}-delimited text:
{
      Assumption is an elected office switch with values Postulated
      (default) and Assumed. Changes to Assumption are secured.

      An active first-class player can make emself the holder of an
      elected office by announcement, provided that both

        (1) the office is either vacant or Assumed, and

        (2) there is no election for that office currently in progress.

      Upon doing so, the office's Assumption is flipped to Assumed.

      When the holder of an office ceases to be an active player, the
      office's Assumption is flipped to Assumed.

      When a person comes to hold an office, or would come to hold an
      office if e did not hold it already, by a means other than the
      one provided by this Rule, then the Assumption of that office is
      flipped to Postulated.
}

Amend Rule 2255 (Major Arcana) by replacing "vacant" with "vacant or
Assumed".
