Change the power of Rule 2127 (Conditional Votes) to 3.

Amend Rule 2127 by replacing "and is clearly specified" with "and,
rules to the contrary notwithstanding, is clearly specified".

[I would not be surprised at all if all conditional votes were
ineffective, as conditional ballots do not clearly identify the option
selected in the normal sense; the strong game custom that "clear" for
a vote doesn't mean what it means in every other case (i.e. clear at
the time) may make the power-1 rule effective anyway, but it would be
better to give it proper authority.]
