Retitle Rule 1698 (Agora Is a Nomic) to "Agora Is A Nomic", and amend
it to read:

     Agora is ossified if it is IMPOSSIBLE for any reasonable
     combination of actions by players to cause arbitrary rule
     changes to be made and/or arbitrary proposals to be adopted
     within a four-week period.

     If, but for this rule, the net effect of a proposal would cause
     Agora to become ossified, it cannot take effect, rules to the
     contrary notwithstanding.  If any other single change to the
     gamestate would cause Agora to become ossified, it is cancelled
     and does not occur, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

[Substantive changes: clarifies what "something other than a Nomic"
(from the newly added paragraph) is, and adds "reasonable" as an
anti-Vladivostok measure.]
