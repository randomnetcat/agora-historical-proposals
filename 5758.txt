Amend Rule 1742 by removing:
      As it is manifestly unjust to bring criminal punishment into a
      manner of equity, if a player is found GUILTY of violating this
      Rule by failing to act in accordance with a contract, the only
      appropriate sentence is DISCHARGE, unless said failure is with
      respect to a previously-imposed Equity judgement.
