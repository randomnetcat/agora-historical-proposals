For the purposes of this proposal, in rule 2126 the list of ways that
VCs may be gained shall be referred to as "list A", and the list of
ways that VCs may be lost shall be referred to as "list B".

Amend rule 2126 by replacing the two consecutive top-level paragraphs
that contain list A and list B with a replacement paragraph that
consists of the introductory sentence "VCs are gained and lost as
follows:" followed by a list made up of these items in this order:
    * label "(+R)", body of item "a)" from list A;
    * label "(-R)", body of item "a)" from list B;
    * label "(+G)", body of item "b)" from list A;
    * label "(-G)", body of item "b)" from list B;
    * label "(+B)", body of item "c)" from list A;
    * label "(-B)", body of item "c)" from list B.

[Meaningful item labels, which are easier to refer to from memory and
are easier to maintain because there's no attempt at an alphabetical
sequence.  Puts rewards and corresponding penalties next to each
other, for easier comprehension.  List's introductory sentence made
less equivocal.]
