Create a rule titled "No Cretans Need Apply" with Power 3 and this text:

     If a rule contains one or more self-contradictory chains of
     clauses claiming precedence over and/or deference to one another,
     then the last claim (when reading the rule from top to bottom)
     involved in one or more such chains has no effect; this process is
     repeated as often as needed until all such chains are broken.
