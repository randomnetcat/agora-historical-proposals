Amend the text in Rule 402 (Identity of the Speaker) reading:

     The Speaker is the active player on the List of Succession who
     became part of the list the longest time ago.  The Herald SHALL
     announce the ascension of a new Speaker asap after it occurs.

to:

     The Speaker is the active player on the List of Succession who
     won the game most recently. The Herald SHALL announce the
     ascension of a new Speaker as soon as possible after it occurs.

[Traditionally, the Speaker was the most recent Player to win the
game. It seems trivial to assign the fifth most recent player to win
the game to be Speaker. This has the added benefit of giving Players
who are already on the List of Succession a reason to win the game
again.]
