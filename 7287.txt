Increase the power of the Rule "The Justiciar" to 2.
[Need to do this to overrule Offices]

Amend the Rule entitled "The Justiciar" to read:

      The Justiciar is an office; its holder is responsible for hot and
      cold running justice.

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the Clerk of the Courts
      CANNOT assume or be nominated for the office of Justiciar, and
      the Justiciar CANNOT assume or be nominated for the office of
      Clerk of the Courts.

      A CFJ may be submitted to the Justiciar.  For such a CFJ, the
      Justiciar shall perform all duties and fulfill all roles that
      would otherwise be assigned to the Clerk of the Courts. This
      takes precedence over Rules that would otherwise assign duties
      and roles regarding a CFJ to the Clerk of the Courts.

      All persons are encouraged to submit a CFJ to the Justiciar only
      when there is a good reason not to submit it to the Clerk of the
      Courts.

      If the Justiciar's Posture is neither Standing nor Sitting, then
      it is flipped to Sitting.


Amend Rule 1871 (The Standing Court) by replacing:
      * Supine (default if the default would otherwise be undefined).
with
      * Supine (default if the current value of Initial Posture is
        undefined; otherwise the current value of Initial Posture is the
        default).

and by appending this paragraph:

       Initial Posture is an Agora Nomic switch, tracked by the Justiciar
       in eir monthly report, with the same values as Posture and a
       default value of Supine.  The Justiciar CAN flip Initial Posture
       with Support.
