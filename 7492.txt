Amend Rule 2403 (Judicial Fees) to read:

     The CotC CAN award Yaks by announcement, but SHALL NOT do so
     except as required by the Rules.

     As soon as possible after a player or an appeals panel judges a
     judicial case within any time limits for doing so, the CotC
     SHALL award A Yaks to the player or B Yaks to each member of the
     judicial panel, where
     a) A is equal to the value of the Standard Case Fee, a Budget
        Switch, and
     b) B is equal to the value of the Standard Appeal Fee, a Budget
        Switch,
     except if the judge in question has already assigned a judgement
     to the same case previously.

     In the week after a judgement is assigned to an appeals case of
     the form "<action> with prejudice", any player CAN destroy any
     Yaks the prior judge was awarded for the prior judgement by
     announcement; the CotC is ENCOURAGED to do so.
