Amend Rule 1504 "Criminal Cases" by adding the following bullet to the
list of valid sentences:

             * LOST OF SUCCESSION, appropriative for moderate rule
               breaches and only if the ninny is on the List of
               Succession. If a judgement of LOST OF SUCCESSION has
               been in effect continuously for seven days (or longer),
               any player CAN once move the ninny to the bottom of the
               List of Succession by announcement, if no other player
               has already done so.
