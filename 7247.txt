[All switches should be tracked by someone, but if the Rules forget to
specify an officer (or even, arguably, if the office is vacant), the
switch shouldn't fail to meet the definition and be in a limbo state
depending on precedence.  There was a recent case about this but I
don't remember the details.]

Amend Rule 2162 (Switches) by replacing:

     c) Exactly one officer who tracks instances of that switch.

with:

     c) Optionally, exactly one office whose holder tracks instances
        of that switch.
