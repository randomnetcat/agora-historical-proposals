Enact a rule with Power=1.1, title "Public Policy", and text:

      The Speaker is obliged to veto, as defined by rule 2019, any
      Ordinary Proposal whose effect if adopted would in eir estimation
      achieve any of these results:

      * seriously hinder, or allow any person or group of people to
        seriously hinder, the adoption of Democratic proposals where the
        proportion of players expressing an opinion who are in favour
        is at least than AI/(AI+1)

      * allow the adoption of Democratic proposals where the proportion
        of players expressing an opinion who are in favour is less
        than AI/(AI+1)

      * impair the effectiveness of this rule

      For the purposes of this rule, the Speaker's estimation is not
      required to be accurate.  Failing to veto a proposal that would
      have one of the above effects is a violation of this rule if and
      only if the Speaker was aware that such an effect was likely.
