In rule 1551 (Ratification, Power=3.1), replace the sentence:

      Ratifying a public document is secured.

with:

      Ratifying a public document is secured with Power threshold 3.

[ Question for Platonists: When was the last time anything actually ratified? ] rules as self-ratifying is
       ratified when it is continuously undoubted for one week,
       provided:
         - at the time of publication, its publisher was a player; or
         - within one week of publication, it was endorsed by someone
           who was a player at that time; or
         - at the time of publication, it was defined by the rules as
           self-ratifying without need of player endorsement.

Amend rule 2170 (Who Am I?) by replacing "self-ratifying" with
"self-ratifying without need of player endorsement"
