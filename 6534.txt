[NOTE: The audit rule is presently rather unclear when it comes to
card destruction. While it seems coppro intended card destruction to
occur in the same message there is trouble implementing that
interpretation. What if the auditing entity is a non-person (say a
rule?)? This proposal clarifies a separate time limit for card
destruction related to an audit.]

In R2259 ("Hand Limits") replace:
{{
When any other entity is audited, the auditing entity (or, if
       there is none, the Accountor) CAN and SHALL by announcement
}}
with:
{{
When any other entity is audited the auditing entity (or the Accountor
if the auditing entity is a non-person) CAN and SHALL as soon as
possible (by announcement)
}}
