[Oceania is at war with Eurasia.  Oceania has always been at war with 
Eurasia.]

For the purpose of this Proposal, "Player A" refers to the Player identified
as follows; "Player A's actions" refers to all actions purported to be
performed by, or to pertain to, Player A.

  * Nickname - Annabel
  * Name     - Lenore McAllister
  * E-mail   - lenore@sdf.lonestar.org

For the purpose of this Proposal, "Player H" refers to the Player identified
as follows; "Player H's actions" refers to all actions purported to be
performed by, or to pertain to, Player H.

  * Nickname - harvel or Maud
  * Name     - Michael Slone

               or mpslon01@morehead-st.edu
               or harvel@vir.fclib.org
               or harvel@cokernel.org
               or maud@cokernel.org
               and possibly others
               but NOT lenore@sdf.lonestar.org

Upon the adoption of this Proposal, the Gamestate becomes what it would be 
if
Player A was always a separate Player from Player H; and if all of Player 
A's
actions were solely Player A's actions, and were not Player H's actions.
