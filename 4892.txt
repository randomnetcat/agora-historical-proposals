Adoption index: 1


(In case Rule 1450 is interpreted as having kept me out of the
Speakership.  Possibly-ex-Speaker Sherlock is my second nominee
for CotC; I considered making em my first nominee, but if R1450
blocked my Speakership, then it would possibly block still-Speaker
Sherlock's Clerkship as well.)

This proposal has no effect unless Murphy's proposal "Fix Separation
of Powers" has been previously adopted.

This proposal has no effect unless at least one candidate for Clerk
of the Courts votes for it.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, Murphy becomes Speaker, and the
first candidate for Clerk of the Courts who voted for it becomes
Clerk of the Courts.

   1) GreyKnight
