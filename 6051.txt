In Which We Do a New Years Sweep of Rules that Seemed Interesting,
But Haven't Amounted To Much, or for which Those Who Were Most
Interested In Them Have Moved On To Something Else.

Repeal Rule 2185 (Foreign Relations)
Repeal Rule 2184 (Foreign communications)
Repeal Rule 2147 (Protectorates)
Repeal Rule 2159 (Protective Decrees)
Repeal Rule 2206 (Foreign Trade)
Repeal Rule 2207 (Trade Embargo)

Amend Rule 2200 (Nomic Definitions) by removing:
     A province is a protectorate that is a player.

Amend R103 (Role of the Speaker) to read:
     The Speaker is an imposed office, and the figurehead of Agora,
     embodying its spirit and its current political mood.  Holding
     the role of Speaker SHOULD be seen as a reward for game
     success; the privileges and abilities granted to the Speaker,
     as specifically defined elsewhere in the Rules, SHOULD in
     general be intended to allow the Speaker to exert a greater
     measure of influence on the game while e holds the office as
     a reward for victory.

To/From Outsiders might be Occasionally Useful].
