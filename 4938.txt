Amend Rule 1023 (Common Definitions) to read:

      The following terms are defined:

        (a) The term "number" shall mean "real number".

        (b) The phrase "as soon as possible" shall mean "within seven
            days".

        (c) The term "random" shall mean a choice drawn with a process
            whose probability distribution among the possible outcomes
            is reasonably close to that required by the Rules, using a
            uniform distribution if not otherwise specified.

        (d) The term "paragraph" shall mean a subset of text determined
            as follows:

            (1) Each bulleted section is a unit of text.

            (2) Any remaining text is divided into units at blank lines.

            (3) Units are considered in a tree hierarchy, interpreting
                the original body of text as a depth-first search.  The
                root is empty, the unbulleted units are its children,
                and the bulleted units following an unbulleted unit are
                its descendants (with nested bullets corresponding to
                nested levels of the tree).

            (4) A "paragraph" identified by partial quotation is
                determined by the minimum sub-tree containing the
                entirety of that quotation.

        (e) Agoran epochs:

            (1) Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.

            (2) Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday.

            (3) Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
                each Gregorian month.

            (4) Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
                April, July, and October begin.

            (5) Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
                begins.
