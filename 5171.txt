Enact a power=2 rule with title "Grammar for Logic" and text

      The following terms are defined for the discussion of logical
      relationships between situations, events, and definitions.  The
      key words are spelled in all capitals.  Where these words are
      used in lowercase these definitions do not necessarily apply,
      but SHOULD be used as a guide to interpretation.

      * <x> IF <y>: if <y> is true then <x> is necessarily the case;
        says nothing about situations where <y> is false.

      * <x> ONLY IF <y>: <not-x> IF <not-y>.

      * <x> IFF <y>: <x> IF <y> and <x> ONLY IF <y>.

      * <x> UNLESS <y>: <x> IF <not-y>.

      * IF <x> THEN <y>: <y> IF <x>.

[Explicitly define these terms to have their usual propositional logic
meaning.  Pavitra has reraised the issue of whether we need them.
This rule text is from "clarify MMI", and is hopefully less
controversial than the rest of that proposal.]
