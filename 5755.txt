Amend Rule 2154 (Replacing Officers) by removing:
      Stability is an elected office switch, tracked by the IADoP,
      with values Temporal (default) and Perpetual.  Any player CAN
      flip an office's stability without 2 objections.  A Perpetual
      office becomes Temporal when its holder leaves office.

      The IADoP SHALL make at least one attempt to install a player
      into an office, and SHALL make the change if possible, under
      the following circumstances:

        a) During a quarter, if the office was Temporal at the start
           of that quarter and no such attempt was made during the
           previous quarter.  This requirement is waived if another
           player makes such a change during the current quarter.

        b) Within a week (or month, if the office is low-priority)
           after the office ceases to have an active holder.  This
           requirement is waived if the office comes to have an
           active holder during that week (month).
