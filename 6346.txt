Amend Rule 2199 (Ribbons) by replacing "any person CAN create that
ribbon in the player's possession by announcement," with "any person CAN
once, in a timely manner (except for White Ribbons, which can be awarded
at any time within a month after they are earned), create that Ribbon in
the player's possession by announcement," and inserting "(earning a
Ribbon more than once entitles the bearer to multiple Ribbon awards,
though capitalizing on this may be difficult)" directly prior to the
colon in that paragraph.
