If a contest exists that defines Trading Cards as a class of asset, it
hereby ceases to be a contest.

Create the following Rule, Trading Cards:

    Trading cards are a class of asset.  Each trading card has a
    Subject, which is a first-class player.  Whenever an entity becomes
    a first- class player, 15 trading cards are created in eir
    possession with emself as their Subject.  If the Subject of a
    trading card ceases to be a first-class player, that trading card is
    destroyed. Trading cards with the same Subject are fungible.

    Comic Book Guy is an Office, and the recordkeepor of Trading Cards.

    Any person CAN spend 12 trading cards, no two of which have the same
    Subject, to fulfill the Victory Condition of Mint Set.  When this
    happens, all trading cards are destroyed, and 15 trading cards are
    created in the possession of each first-class player, with that
    first- class player as their Subject.

If, immediately before this proposal took effect, a contest existed that
defined Trading Cards as a class of asset, then:

    - The contestmaster of that former contest becomes the Postulated
      holder of Comic Book Guy.
    - Trading cards are created with the same Subjects and Owners as
      they had according to the contest immediately before this proposal
      took effect.

Otherwise:

    - 15 trading cards are created in the possession of each first-class
      player, with that first-class player as their Subject.
