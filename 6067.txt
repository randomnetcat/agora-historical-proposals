Amend Rule 2178 (Public Contracts) by replacing:
     Changes in the text or list of parties of a public contract do
     not become effective until they are published.

with:
     A wiki is a website which can be reasonably accessed and
     modified by all players.  The Notary wiki is the wiki designated
     as such by the Notary; the Notary SHALL continuously designate
     an operational wiki for this purpose.  Contract Changes to
     public contracts do not become effective until the Notary wiki
     is updated to reflect them, rules to the contrary
     notwithstanding.

[We can't seem to find a Notary who won't let the wiki get out of date
(as it is now), and why should we?  The situation is perfectly suited
for a wiki.  With this proposal, unposted changes platonically do not
occur, so the wiki is always right and parties will presumably update
it themselves.  If the Notary wiki is unoperational (it's on wikidot,
so I doubt this will happen for significant periods of time except
through malice), Contract Changes cannot occur, but a replacement can
be easily designated (through deputisation if necessary).  Note that
if this proposal passes, the wiki will need to be made publicly
editable.]
