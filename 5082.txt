Title: better VLOP balance after wins
Author: Zefram
Co-authors: 
Adoption index: 2

Amend the rule titled "Voting on Ordinary Proposals" by replacing the
text "BVLOP of a first-class player is one" with "BVLOP of a
first-class player is four".

[This prevents the VCs that are held at the time of a win carrying the
overwhelming power that they presently do.  One player's VVLOP being
increased by 20 immediately after a VVLOP reset won't outweigh all the
other players as it presently would.]

[This proposal assumes the prior adoption of "refactor voting limits".
It has no effect otherwise.]
