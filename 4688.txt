Create a new rule titled "Honorary Degrees", with power 2, reading:

      A degree may be awarded by the operation of an adopted Proposal
      whose Power is at least two to any person who is not registered as
      a Player and who does not already bear that degree.  The Proposal
      must specify both the recipient of the degree and the degree to be
      awarded.  For a degree to be awarded in this manner, the recipient
      need not complete a Thesis, but all other requirements specific to
      the degree in question must be satisfied.

      Degrees awarded as described in this rule shall be marked as
      honorary degrees in the Herald's report.  A person bearing an
      honorary degree may still be awarded the same degree by other
      rule-defined mechanisms.  When this occurs, the person shall
      cease to bear the honorary degree and shall bear the new degree
      in its place.
