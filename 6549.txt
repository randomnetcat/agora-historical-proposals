In the fifth paragraph of Rule 2156, replace the second sentence with
"The voting limit of a player on an ordinary decision is eir base
voting limit on that decision (as defined elsewhere in the rules),
plus one for each Extra Vote card e owns, minus one for each positive
multiple of two Rests the player owns. This rule defers to other rules
of equal power in the determination of voting limits."

Create a new Power-2 Rule entitled "Base Voting Limits" with the same
text as the last three paragraphs of Rule 2156, and delete those
paragraphs from Rule 2156.
