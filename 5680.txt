 Amend the Rule entitled "The Grand Poobah" by inserting the
 following paragraph after the first paragraph:

     The Grand Poobah CAN generally flip a Player's caste by
     announcement, but SHALL only do so as explicitly described by
     the Rules.  If the result of a claim of error or court case
     finds that e has flipped a Player's caste illegally (e.g. not
     as specified by the Rules), e SHALL flip the caste to the
     appropriate correct value as soon as possible.

     If a player believes that a caste switch has been flipped
     illegally, e CAN switch it back with three Support, provided e
     has first raised a claim of error or court case concerning the
     matter.  However e (and supporters) SHALL defer to the courts
     and the Grand Poobah's ability to correct the issue, unless
     they present a good and pressing reason not to do so; abuse of
     this ability should not be taken lightly by the courts.
