Create a rule titled "Entanglement" with Power 2 and this text:

      Two entities are entangled if and only if the intersection of
      their bases is non-empty.

Amend Rule 1450 (Separation of Powers) to read:

      Lest the entire proposal process fall under the control of a
      single entity, any change that would result in the holders of
      Promotor and Assessor being entangled is canceled and does not
      occur, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

      Lest the entire judicial process fall under the control of a
      single entity, any change that would result in the holder of
      Clerk of the Courts and the owner of Justiciar being entangled
      is canceled and does not occur, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.
