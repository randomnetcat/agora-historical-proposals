Create a new rule entitled "Deckmastor's Ephemera" with the following
text:

      At the end of each month the Deckmastor may award the following
      ephemeral patent titles:

      * BestPlay, to the player who contributed most to Cards in
        general or the player or players that made the best play of
        cards the eyes of the Deckmastor, during the month.

      * IgnorantGamer (Dynamic, but with its Karma set initially to
        Albatross), to the player whose attempts at making draws and
        playing cards failed the most, during the month.  If there is
        more than on player who meets the criteria for this ephemeral
        patent title, they all receive it.
