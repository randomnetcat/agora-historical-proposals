Amend Rule 911 (Appeal Cases) by appending this text:

      The judge of a previously-appealed question SHALL NOT assign
      the same judgement to it without new reasoning that addresses
      the serious doubt about its appropriateness.  Violating this
      prohibition is the Class-N Crime of Lazy Judging, where N is
      the judge's rank when e so judged.
