Proposal:  Odds and Ends

[Just a couple odds and ends].


Repeal Rule 1989 (Prime Executors).
   [Holdover from economics days really, other rules specify who
    is responsible for what without this].


Amend Rule 1727 (Happy Birthday) by replacing:

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, as soon as possible after the end
      of Agora's Birthday, the Herald shall award the boon of
      celebration to each Player who, during Agora's Birthday,
      publicly recognized Agora's Birthday;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Herald may select one Contract,
      in existence on Agora's Birthday, which has as its purpose
      encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday.  Within the
      month following Agora's Birthday, that Contract may award its
      Members the Patent Title Nth Anniversary Ribbon, where N is the
      number of years of Agora's existence;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Courts shall be closed on
      Agora's Birthday; that is, the Clerk of the Courts shall not
      publish any Calls For Judgement, Judgements, notices of Appeals,
      Decisions of Appeals Boards, or Opinions, on Agora's Birthday;
      nor shall any Player submit to the Clerk of the Courts a Call
      For Judgement, notice of ineligibility to Judge, Judgement, call
      for Appeal, or Appellate Decision, on Agora's Birthday; nor
      shall any Player submit an Application to Submit an Opinion on
      Agora's Birthday; however, if any of the above do take place on
      Agora's Birthday, in violation of this Rule, this Rule does not
      deprive them of their usual effects.

with:

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year, and as soon
      as possible after the end of Agora's Birthday, the Herald shall
      award the boon of celebration to each Player who, during Agora's
      Birthday, publicly recognizes this Grand Event.


[Why bother to close the courts for a day?  And also, that contest
hasn't been used since it was created.  The best part of the birthday
is just saying happy birthday!]
