If Rule 1023 (Common Definitions) contains the word 'Indeterminate'
then:

  Amend Rule 2338 (Cashing Promises) by inserting the following
  paragraph after the second paragraph:

      If cashing a promise would lead, through its own actions
      or actions directly caused by its cashing, to a value being
      indeterminate an instant after the promise is cashed, then
      (other provisions of this or other rules notwithstanding)
      it CANNOT be cashed.


If Rule 1023 (Common Definitions) does NOT contain the word
'Indeterminate' then:

  Amend Rule 2338 (Cashing Promises) by inserting the following
  paragraph after the second paragraph:

      If cashing a promise would lead, through its own actions
      or actions directly caused by its cashing, to a value being
      undefined or unable to be determined (without circularity
      or paradox) with reasonable effort an instant after the
      promise is cashed, then (other provisions of this or other
      rules notwithstanding) it CANNOT be cashed.
