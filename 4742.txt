Proposal: Herald's Ephemera
Create a new rule entitled "Herald's Ephemera" with the following text:

   Before the end of each turning, the Herald may award the following
   ephemeral patent titles:

  * UnLuck, to the player who has the most albatrosses at the
    end of the turning.  If there is more than one, they all receive
    this ephemeral patent title.

  * Luck (Dynamic, but with its Karma set initially to
    Albatross), to the player who has the most boons at the
    end of the turning, if there is more than one, they all receive
    this ephemeral patent title.
