Amend Rule 478 (Fora) by replacing this text:

           Any action performed by sending a message is performed at
      the time date-stamped on that message.

with this text:

           Any action performed by sending a message is performed at
      the time date-stamped on that message, unless the message clearly
      and unambiguously specifies a different time within 24 hours
      after that time, in which case it is performed at the specified
      time instead.
