Amend the rule "Regeneration" by prepending to the numbered list the
following:

          0. Time is stopped.  Whatever means used in the universe to
             track time is stopped as of the beginning of the
             regeneration.  As a result, it is IMPOSSIBLE to spend
             time writing messages, so no actions may be taken,
             including the ones in this rule.
