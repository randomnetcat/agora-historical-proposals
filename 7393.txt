In Rule 2387, after the sentence "If a player does not possess the
Patent Title Renascent, e CAN earn a Transparent Ribbon by
announcement.", insert the sentence "Having earned a Transparent
Ribbon in the past week is the Losing Condition of Haste." (Currently,
if a person earns a Transparent Ribbon immediately before winning by
Renaissance, e can award emself the Ribbon after gaining the Patent
Title Renascent. This fix is inelegant but interesting.)
