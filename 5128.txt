Title: democratic interest
Author: Zefram
Co-authors: Murphy
Adoption index: 2

Murphy is a coauthor of this proposal.

Amend rule 2126 by replacing item "a)" of the list of ways that VCs
may be gained with

      a) When an interested proposal is adopted, its proposer gains a
         number of Red VCs equal to the integer portion of the
         proposal's adoption index, minus the number of Red VCs that e
         has gained in this way earlier in the same week (down to a
         minimum of zero), and each coauthor named in the proposal
         gains one Red VC unless e gained a VC in this way earlier in
         the same week.

[I've got bored of waiting for Murphy to propose VC rewards for
democratic proposals as e protoed.  This version incorporates my
refinement of the one-per-week clause.]
