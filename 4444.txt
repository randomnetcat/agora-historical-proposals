Proposal:  Trifecta, Part 2 of 3
(AI=4, please)

[Put epochs in their place.]

Upon the adoption of this Proposal, the Gamestate becomes what it would be 
if
all relative durations expressed in terms of epochs were interpreted as 
having
their ordinary-language meaning, Rule 459 (Agoran Epochs) notwithstanding.

Amend Rule 459 (Agoran Epochs) to read:

      Days, weeks, months, quarters, and years are epochs.  The
      corresponding Agoran epochs are Agoran days, Agoran weeks,
      Agoran months, Agoran quarters, and Agoran years, respectively.

      Agoran days begin at midnight GMT.  Agoran weeks begin at midnight
      GMT on Monday.  Agoran months begin at midnight GMT on the first
      day of each Gregorian month.  Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran
      months of January, April, July, and October begin.  Agoran years
      begin when the Agoran month of January begins.  An Agoran epoch
      lasts until the next Agoran epoch of the same type begins.

      Except in this Rule, when the Rules refer to an epoch as an
      independent entity (e.g. "each month"), they shall be interpreted
      as referring to the corresponding Agoran epoch.  However, when the
      Rules refer to an epoch as a relative duration (e.g. "one month
      after", "within one month", "for one month"), they shall be
      interpreted as referring to the ordinary-language meaning of that
      duration.

      Automatic events that happen daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or
      yearly happen at the beginning of the corresponding Agoran
      epoch.  Any activity that must be performed daily, weekly, monthly,
      quarterly, or yearly must be performed at least once during each
      corresponding Agoran epoch.

      Other Rules may explicitly define alternate schedules for events
      or classes of events.
