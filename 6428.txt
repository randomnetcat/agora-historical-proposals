At the beginning of each
      week, each holder of a high-priority office who completed a non-
      empty set of duties in the prior week earns a number of draws
      from the deck indicated by the switch equal to the interest
      index for the office.  At the beginning of each month, each
      holder of a low-priority office who held the office for 16 or
      more days in the prior month earns a number of draws from the
      deck indicated by the switch equal to the interest index of the
      office.

     week, each holder of an office with a weekly report who published
     that report in the previous week earns a number of draws from the
     deck indicated by the switch equal to the interest index for that
     office. At the beginning of each month, each holder of an office
     without a weekly report who held the office for 16 or more days in
     the prior month earns a number of draws from the deck indicated by
     the switch equal to the interest index of the office.
