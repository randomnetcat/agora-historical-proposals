Author: OscarMeyr

Adoption index: 3


Amend R106 by replacing the text:
       The default adoption index of a proposal is one.  Before the
       Promotor distributes a proposal, its proposer may modify its
       adoption index by announcement.  A Proposal with an Adoption
       Index of 1 is Ordinary.  All other Proposals are Democratic.

With this text:

The adoption index of a proposal is a positive integer, with a default
value of one.  Before the Promotor distributes a proposal, its proposer
may modify its adoption index by announcement.  A Proposal with
an Adoption Index of 1 is Ordinary.  All other Proposals are Democratic.
