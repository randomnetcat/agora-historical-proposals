If possible, amend rule 1871 by replacing the text "if e was turned
when it was called" with "if e is turned".  Otherwise, amend rule 1871
by replacing the text "if e was not standing when it was called" with
"if e is not standing".

[Turn status matters at the moment of assignment, not when the CFJ is
called.  Two versions of the amendment to make the same logical change
regardless of whether "The Standing Court" passes.]
