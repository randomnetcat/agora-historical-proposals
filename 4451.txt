Proposal: Holiday Registration Fix

Amend Rule 869 by inserting the following delimited text:

###
Whenever a Player registers during a Holiday, eir Grace Period shall be 
extended by a period of time equal to the time which elapses between eir 
registration and the conclusion of that Holiday, provided that no other Rule 
extends eir Grace Period by reason of that Holiday.
###

That text shall be inserted in the Rule immediately prior to the following 
delimited text:

###
For the purposes of determining when a Player's Grace Period is scheduled to 
conclude, where more than one Holiday falls fully or partially within that 
Grace Period, the calculation shall be made separately for each Holiday.
