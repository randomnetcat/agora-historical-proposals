Amend Rule 2150 by replacing:
      "First-class person" means a person of a biological nature.

      "First-class player" means a player who is a first-class person.
with:

      A first-class person is a person of a biological nature.  All
      other persons are second-class.

[I don't think the second definition is necessary.]
