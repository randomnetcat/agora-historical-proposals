Amend Rule 591 (Inquiry Cases) by replacing the text reading:

      * UNDECIDABLE, appropriate if the statement was logically
        undecidable, nonsensical, too vague, or otherwise not capable
        of being accurately described as either false or true, at the
        time the inquiry case was initiated

with:

      * UNDECIDABLE, appropriate if the statement was logically
        undecidable or otherwise not capable of being accurately
        described as either false or true, at the time the inquiry
        case was initiated

and the text reading:

      * UNDETERMINED, appropriate if the information available to the
        judge is insufficient to determine which of the FALSE, TRUE,
        and UNDECIDABLE judgements is appropriate; however,
        uncertainty as to how to interpret or apply the rules cannot
        constitute insufficiency of information for this purpose

with:

      * UNDETERMINED, appropriate if the statement is nonsensical or
        too vague, or if the information available to the judge is
        insufficient to determine which of the FALSE, TRUE, and
        UNDECIDABLE judgements is appropriate; however, uncertainty as
        to how to interpret or apply the rules cannot constitute
        insufficiency of information for this purpose
