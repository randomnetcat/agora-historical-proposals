Amend Rule 1482 (Precedence between Rules with Unequal Power) by  
appending
this text:

       If the Rule with the higher Power explicitly says of itself  
that it
       defers to another Rule (or type of Rule), then such provisions  
shall
       supercede the Power method for determining precedence.
