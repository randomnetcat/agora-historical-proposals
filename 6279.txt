[Now that second-class registration is restricted, other restrictions
can be loosened up.]

Amend Rule 1868 (Judge Assignment Generally) by removing "first-class"
from this text:

      The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of a judicial
      case are the active first-class players,

Create a rule titled "Second-Class Judges" with Power 2 and this text:

      If any first-class member of a second-class person's basis would
      be unqualified to judge a given judicial case, even if e were
      registered, active, standing, hemming-and-hawing, and Supreme,
      then that second-class person is unqualified to judge that case.
