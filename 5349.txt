Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by appending this text after the
section describing APOLOGY:

      * FINE with an integer from 1 to 100, appropriate for rule
        breaches of small consequence.  When in effect, the ninny
        SHALL within 72 hours destroy the specified number of Marks,
        or 1 VC, of the color(s) of eir choice.  The ninny is only
        obliged to perform one destruction per question on sentencing,
        even if sentences of this type are assigned more than once or
        go into effect more than once.

[Strictly less severe than CHOKEY with a one-second sentence, which
auto-dings the ninny 1 Black VC but has no other significant effect.]
