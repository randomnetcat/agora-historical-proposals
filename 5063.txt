Amend rule 2136 by replacing the text from "is eir score" up to but
not including the next "." with "is eir score, which is always an
algebraic real number, and scores are not categorically prevented from
being any particular algebraic real number".

[If this is adopted, it overrides "real scores".  It will be
overridden if "rational scores" or "integer scores" is adopted.]
