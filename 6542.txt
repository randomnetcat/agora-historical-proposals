Amend Rule 911 (Appeal Cases) by replacing the paragraph beginning

     The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of an appeal case

with this text:

     The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of an appeal case
     are the judicial panels consisting of max(3,1+2*R) members (where
     R is the rank of the prior case), where each of the members is
     qualified to be assigned as judge of the prior case and none is
     the prior judge.  If possible, the CotC SHALL assign a panel where
     each of the members is well qualified to be assigned as judge of
     the prior case.
