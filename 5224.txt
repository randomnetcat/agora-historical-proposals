Amend Rule 2154 (Replacing Officers) by replacing the paragraph
containing "If no attempt to achieve Agoran Consent" with this text:

      Stability is an office switch, tracked by the IADoP, with
      values Temporal (default) and Perpetual.  Any player CAN flip
      an office's stability without 2 objections.  A Perpetual office
      becomes Temporal when its holder leaves office.

      If an office is Temporal at the end of a quarter, and no attempt
      to change the holder of that office with Agoran consent was made
      during that quarter, then the IADoP SHALL make at least one such
      attempt in the following quarter, and SHALL make the change if
      consent is achieved.  These requirements are waived if another
      player makes such a change during the following quarter.
