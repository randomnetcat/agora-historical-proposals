Append the following to the end of Rule 2193:
{{{
      The initiation of a Monstrous decree is a secured change.  The
      initiating instrument must specify the target Monster and
      the changes to be made to it.  Any ambiguity in the
      specification of a Monstrous decree causes it to be void and
      without effect.  This is the only mechanism by which a
      Monstrous decree can be initiated.
}}}
