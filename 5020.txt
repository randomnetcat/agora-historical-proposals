Enact a rule titled "Policy on Judicial Assignments" with text:

      When the Clerk of the Courts must choose a Trial Judge, e
      shall choose randomly.  The Clerk of the Courts may, without
      objection, replace this requirement with some other means of
      choice for a particular CFJ.

      This rule does not affect which entities are eligible to judge
      a particular CFJ.  This rule takes precedence over other rules
      governing the selection between eligible entities for Trial
      Judge.

      The Clerk of the Courts can cause this rule to repeal itself,
      without 4 objections.

[This formalises Goethe's announced policy.  The second sentence allows
for exceptions, such as I have advocated for particularly tricky CFJs,
by general consent; this arrangement is flexible enough to allow a
completely non-random choice or a random choice among a shortlist.
The final paragraph provides an abbreviated procedure to end the policy,
when no longer thought necessary; 4 objections is what the would-be
Oligarchs can trivially muster.]
