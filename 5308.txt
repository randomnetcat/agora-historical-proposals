Hang, hang!

[What's war without overreaction?]

Enact the following rule:

    A player MUST NOT provide material support or substantial
    encouragement to another nomic in taking hostile action against
    Agora.  A judge who finds a player guilty of breaking this
    Rule SHALL award the guilty party the patent title Traitor.

    A player is instantly deregistered when e comes to hold the
    patent title Traitor.  A person holding the patent title
    Traitor CANNOT register.

Amend Rule 649 (Patent Titles) by appending the following text:

    If the rules require or allow a player to award (or revoke)
    a patent title, that player CAN make the described award (or
    revocation) by announcement.

[Used to be in the Rules, I thought it still was].
