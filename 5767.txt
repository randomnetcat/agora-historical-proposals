Amend Rule 2124 (Agoran Satisfaction) by replacing this text:

     The Executor of such an announcement of intent CANNOT support
     nor object to it.

with this text:

     The Executor of such an announcement of intent CANNOT support it,
     but CAN generally object to it (withdrawal of intent is equivalent
     to objection).

[Just as the old tactic of "announce intent, let support build up,
then don't go through with it" led to the amendment of R1728 to let a
supporter go through with it, so this avoids the similar tactic of
"announce intent, let partial support build up, then withdraw intent";
this is important when going through with it is subject to a separate
time limit, e.g. initiating an appeal.]
