Amend Rule 2181 (The Accountor) to read:

      The Accountor is a low-priority office; its holder is responsible
      for keeping track of miscellaneous assets.

      The Accountor is the default recordkeepor for all assets that do
      not specify a different recordkeepor.  While there are no such
      assets, the Accountor has no report.
