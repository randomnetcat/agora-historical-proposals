Amend Rule 478 (Fora) by replacing the text reading:

      A player performs an action "by announcement" by announcing that
      e performs it.  Any action performed by sending a message is
      performed at the time date-stamped on that message.

with:

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a player performs that action by announcing that
      e performs it.  Any action performed by sending a message is
      performed at the time date-stamped on that message.
