Amend this paragraph in Rule 1742:
      As it is manifestly unjust to bring criminal punishment into a
      manner of equity, if a player is found GUILTY of violating this
      Rule by failing to act in accordance with a contract, the only
      appropriate sentence is DISCHARGE, unless said failure is with
      respect to a previously-imposed Equity judgement.
by replacing "contract" with "contract that has never been a partnership".

[A contract could terminate or cease to be a partnership.]
