Amend Rule 2313 (Urgent Proposals) by deleting the first paragraph and
replacing the second paragraph with
       The Promotor CAN distribute an Urgent Proposal as soon as
       possible, unless it ceases to be Urgent in the mean time. Failure
       to do so is the Class 1 Crime of Lack of Urgency.

Amend Rule 1607 (The Promotor) by removing the second and fourth paragraphs.

Amend Rule 2284 (Fee-based actions) by removing the second, third, and
fourth paragraphs.

Enact a new Rule at power 2 entitled "Distributability" which reads
       Distributability is a switch possessed by proposals in the
       proposal pool and tracked by the Promotor. Its possible values are
       Undistributable (default), Distributable, and Urgent.

       A player CAN flip a specified interested and Undistributable
       proposal to Distributable without a number of objections equal to
       4 - II (where II is the interest index of the specified proposal).
       A player CAN flip a specified disinterested and Undistributable
       proposal to Distributable by announcement.

       A player CAN make a proposal Undistributable for a charge of two
       ergs, make a Distributable proposal Urgent, vice versa for a
       charge of two ergs. A player CAN also make an Undistributable
       proposal Distributable for a charge of one erg.
