Adoption index: 3.0

Ratify the message published to agora-official most recently before
this proposal was submitted which
 (a) is titled "Short Logical Ruleset",
 (b) starts with "THE SHORT LOGICAL RULESET", and
 (c) ends with "END OF THE SHORT LOGICAL RULESET";

however, where a rule includes a note stating that its text might be
different due to a scam, the entire text of the rule is considered
unclearly identified and is specifically excluded from ratification.
[In accordance with the policy I posted recently, there are four such
notes; they start with '[!'.]

[Ratifying the ruleset without objection has been impossible since P6048.]
