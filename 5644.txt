Amend Rule 2019 (Prerogatives) by replacing section b) with this text:

      b) Justiciar.  Once within three days after an appeal case comes
         to require a judge, the Justiciar CAN make that case either
         hot or cold by announcement.  If the Justiciar has not done
         so, then the Clerk of the Courts SHALL NOT assign a panel to
         that case during this period.  If the Justiciar has done so,
         then the Clerk of the Courts SHALL assign a panel including
         (if the case is hot) or excluding (if it is cold) the
         Justiciar, if possible.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, the Prerogative of Justiciar is
assigned to the person (if any) to whom the Prerogative of Default
Justice was assigned immediately before the adoption of this proposal.
