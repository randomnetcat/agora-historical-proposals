Amend Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) by appending, to this paragraph:

     A proposal is a document outlining changes to be made to Agora,
     including enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making
     other explicit changes to the gamestate.

this text:

     The text of a proposal CANNOT change after it is distributed;
     however, this does not affect any other entity (proposal or
     otherwise) solely because that entity has the same text.
