Proposal: Finite Library

Amend Rule 2089 (Gardner Library) to read:

      A player (hereafter the Borrower) may check out a specified card
      from the Library by announcement, which must satisfy a number of
      satisfiable pending draws that e, in fact, possesses.  The
      number is 2 pending draws for Students and 1 pending draw for
      Faculty Members.  Whenever a card is checked out from the
      Library, it is transferred to the Borrower, and the Library
      gains a pending draw.

      The President of the University may discard any card in the
      possession of the Library and replace it with a pending draw,
      without two objections.  If the Library has no cards and no
      pending draws, the President may grant the Library 5 pending
      draws, by announcement.


The Library is hereby deemed to have exactly 5 pending draws.
