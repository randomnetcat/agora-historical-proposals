Amend Rule 1586 (Definition and Continuity of Entities) by replacing
the first paragraph with the following text:
(
      If multiple rules attempt to define an entity with the same
      name, then they refer to the same entity.  A rule-defined
      entity's name CANNOT be changed to be the same as another
      rule-defined entity's name.
)
and by replacing all instances of "document" in it with the "rule".

Amend Rule 754 (Definitions) by replacing the bullet point (4) with
the following text:
(
      (4) Any term not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule
          by default has its ordinary-language meaning. In determining
          the ordinary-language meaning of a term, definitions
          contained in lower-powered Rules, followed by definitions
          used in other Agoran legal documents, SHOULD be used for
          guidance.
)

Amend Rule 2166 (Assets) to read:
(
      An asset is an entity defined as such by the rules.

      Each asset has exactly one owner.  If an asset would otherwise
      lack an owner, it is owned by the Lost and Found Department.  If
      the rules restrict the ownership of an asset to a class of
      entities, then that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred to
      an entity outside that class, and is transfered to the Lost and
      Found Department if it is owned by an entity outside that class.
       If an asset is owned by the Lost and Found department any
      player CAN transfer or destroy it without objection.  The Lost
      and Found department may own any asset.

      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity (if any)
      defined as such by the rules.  That entity's report includes a
      list of all instances of that class and their owners.  This
      portion of that entity's report is self-ratifying.

      To "gain" an asset is to have it created in one's possession; to
      "award" an asset to an entity is to create it in that entity's
      possession.
)

Amend Rule 2181 by replacing the last paragraph with the following text:
(
      The Accountor's monthly report includes a list of all classes of
      assets and their recordkeepors.
