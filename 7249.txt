Create a new Power-3 rule titled "Messy Statements":

    A statement is messy if its truth value cannot be evaluated in a
    top-down fashion without encountering some form of infinite
    regress, such as (but not limited to) self-reference.

    For the purposes of the rules, messy statements are considered
    inaccurate and incorrect regardless of their truth value.
