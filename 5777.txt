If this is Agora, create a rule with power 1 called "Export
Bootstraping" whose text is as follows:
{{{
If a B Nomic proposal whose title is "Export" has been adopted in B
Nomic, any player CAN repeal this rule and rules 2192 and 2193 by
announcement.
If a B Nomic proposal whose title is "Export" has been rejected in B
Nomic, any player CAN repeal this rule by announcement.
}}}

If this is B Nomic, create a rule with the same text and title as
Agora's rule 2192, and a rule with the same text and title as Agora's
rule 2193. B Nomic players are encouraged to further modify the
resulting rules by proposal to be more appropriate to B Nomic.
