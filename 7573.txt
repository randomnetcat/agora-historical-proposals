Title: Seriously, Cretans, get out of here
Author: Machiavelli

Adoption index: 3

To Rule 2240 "No Cretans Need Apply", append the following paragraph:

If, under some set of circumstances, a single clause of a rule
conflicts with itself (and the conflict is not between two different
parts of the clause), then that clause shall be considered meaningless
under those circumstances.

[Remind me, again, why some unspecified paraconsistent logic is
superior to classical logic? I just don't see any advantages at all.]
