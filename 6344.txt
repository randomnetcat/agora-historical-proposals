Create a new power=1 rule titled "Nicknames" with the text:
{{
As soon as possible after registering for the first time a player CAN
and SHALL select a unique nickname to be used by Agora in the
identification of that player on official documents. That nickname
shall be used in the identification of that player even if later they
cease to be registered. A person with a recognized nickname CAN change
that nickname by announcement. Changing a nickname this way if it has
been changed or created within the past 90 days is a class 5 crime of
Assuming a Misleading Identity.

Selecting a nickname that contains more than 20 characters, or more
than two non-alphanumeric characters is the class 5 crime of Mentally
Assaulting an Officer, unless at the same time as the selection the
player changing nicknames supplies a suitable abbreviation which fits
the required definition.
