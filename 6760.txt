Amend Rule 2300 by replacing
        Recording the Captain's Log (1) - Causes the Shuttle to
        activate the very fancy recording device for full hologram
        recording, which causes all other systems to go offline. The
        Shuttle can then not take any other actions until the end of
        the next day.  During this time any other player can, with 2
        support, initiate a mutiny which moves the pusher of the
        Captain's Log button to the Outside. If this does not happen,
        the player doing the recording may save it within one day for
        a cost of 2 ergs. A player who successfully performs this
        action twice within a single month satisfies the winning
        condition of Continuity.
