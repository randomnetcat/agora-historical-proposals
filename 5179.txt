Amend rule 2149 by appending the paragraph

      Merely quoting a statement does not constitute publishing it for
      the purposes of this rule.  Any disclaimer, conditional clause,
      or other qualifier attached to a statement constitutes part of
      the statement for the purposes of this rule; the truth or
      falsity of the whole is what is significant.
