Replace the first paragraph of Rule 1728 with:
      A rule or contract which purports to allow a person (the
      performer) to perform an action by a set of one or more of the
      following methods (N is 1 unless otherwise specified):

and, in Rule 1728, replace "if and only if" with "if".

Replace the first two paragraphs of Rule 2124 with:

      A Supporter of a dependent action is an eligible entity who has
      publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support (syn. "consent") for
      an announcement of intent to perform the action.  An Objector to
      a dependent action is an eligible entity who has publicly posted
      (and not withdrawn) an objection to the announcement of intent
      to perform the action.

      The entities eligible to support or object to a dependent action
      are, by default, all first-class players, subject to
      modification by the document authorizing the dependent action.
      However, the previous sentence notwithstanding, the Executor of
      the announcement of intent is not eligible to support it.

Change the Power of Rule 2124 to 3.  (May as well fix the power
escalation while we're at it.)
