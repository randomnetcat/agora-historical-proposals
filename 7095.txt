Enact a new power-3 rule with the following text:

Agora can make its own decisions. If, at any time, Agora wishes to
counteract a decision, then that decision, rules to the contrary
notwithstanding, has no effect. The game of Agora, but not any player
of it, can make arbitrary changes to the gamestate.
