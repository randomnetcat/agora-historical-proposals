Create the following rule:
        There are 5 elephants.
        There is an elephant switch, known as Elephant Location; its valid values are
        North, South, East, West, and Over There (default). It is tracked by the
        Department of Mental Health.

Upon adoption of this proposal: four elephants have their Elephant Location
set to the cardinal directions.
