Amend rule 2136 by replacing "is eir score" with "is eir score, and is
always a non-negative integer".

[It is otherwise unclear what the domain of scores is.]

Amend rule 1023 by deleting the item

      (a) The term "number" shall mean "real number".

[Each instance of "number" in the ruleset either is discussing a value
that is inherently a natural number or is explicitly qualified as
"rational" or some other subset of the real numbers.]
