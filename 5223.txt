Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing the text reading:

      The initiation of a criminal case begins its pre-trial phase.
      During the pre-trial phase, the case requires a judge.  In the
      pre-trial phase the judge SHALL as soon as possible inform the
      defendant of the case and invite em to rebut the argument for
      eir guilt.

with:

      The initiation of a criminal case begins its pre-trial phase.
      In the pre-trial phase the CotC SHALL as soon as possible inform
      the defendant of the case and invite em to rebut the argument
      for eir guilt.

[The CotC can't recuse a judge in the pre-trial phase, so let's just
 not require one.  There is no particular advantage to having a judge
 perform the pre-trial notification rather than the CotC, so the KiSS
 principle applies.]
