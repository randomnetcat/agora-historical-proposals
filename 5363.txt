Title: Define the Accountor
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: 
Adoption index: 2

[This should have been part of Proposal 5336.]

Create a Rule titled "The Accountor" with this text:

      The Accountor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of assets.

      The Accountor is the default recordkeepor for all assets
      that do not specify a different recordkeepor.

[The rules allow for non-currency assets.]

Amend Rule 2126 (Voting Credits) by replacing "Assessor" with
"Accountor".

Amend Rule 2176 (Marks) by replacing "Assessor" with "Accountor".

[These are worth making explicit.  Unlike the previous proposal to
make the CotC the recordkeepor of Blue VCs, Proposal 5336 was
intended to simply require the CotC to report Blue VC changes to
the Accountor.]

Upon the adoption of this proposal, if the AFO is Assessor, then
Murphy is installed as Assessor.

[I believe this is mine, carp.]

Upon the adoption of this proposal, the Assessor is installed as
Accountor.
