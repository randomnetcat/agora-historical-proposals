Amend Rule 217 to read:
     When interpreting and applying the rules, the following
     considerations take precedence in order from top to bottom, each
     having no weight unless all points above it collectively yield
     no clear interpretation or application of the rules:

       a) the text of the rules;

       b) past judgements;

       c) game custom;

       d) the best interests of the game;

       e) common sense.
