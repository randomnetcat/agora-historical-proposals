Create a new Rule entitled "Agoran Contracts" which reads as follow:

      There exists a type of Contract known as Agoran Contract. An
      Agoran Contract is a Contract between any two entities. An
      Agoran Contract may only be created or amended by a Proposal and
      becomes effective when the Proposal takes effect. Unless
      otherwise specified in the Rules or Regulations, All Players are
      automatically Members of Agoran Contracts and no Player may
      leave an Agoran Contract.

      All Rules regulating Contracts that are inconsistent with this
      Rule are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

      The ADoP is required to keep track of all Agoran Contracts.
