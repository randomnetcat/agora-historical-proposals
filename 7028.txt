[Promotor note: This proposal was submitted on April 2, but never
distributed because for some reason Wooble marked it as
undistributable, and I forgot about it until Walker reminded me about
it... twice.]

Amend Rule 2154 (Election Procedure) by replacing the text from "A
player" to "otherwise." with:

     A player CAN initiate an election for a specified elected office
     for which no election is already in progress by announcement.
