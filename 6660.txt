Amend Rule 1023 (Common Definitions) by appending this text after
section (b) (5):

           (5) A pivot is either the instant at which Agora Nomic began
               (June 30, 1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200) or an instant at which
               at least one person won the game.  When used as a period
               of time, a "game" is the period of time between a pivot
               and the next pivot.

Repeal Rule 2244 (The Games of Agora).
