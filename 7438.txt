Adoption index: 2

In rule 1950, after "secured with a power threshold of 2", add ", and
tracked by the Assessor". [This makes more sense than requiring the
Promotor to report it, as they both need the information, and the
Assessor is in charge of deadline extensions. It's close, though.]

At the end of rule 1950, add "24 hours after an Agoran Decision is
resolved, its Adoption Index and Chamber are flipped to their default
values." [Removes the need to track pointless values on old proposals.]

For each resolved Agoran Decision, and each Agoran Decision created more
than 90 days ago, flip its Adoption Index and Chamber to their default
values.
