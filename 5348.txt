Amend Rule 2125 (Regulation Regulations) to read:

      An action is regulated if and only if at least one of the
      following is true:

        (a) The rules specify that the action CANNOT be performed in
            some or all circumstances.

        (a) The rules specify that the action MAY NOT be performed in
            some or all circumstances.

        (c) The action would, as part of its effect, modify information
            that some player is REQUIRED to record.  Any such action
            CANNOT be performed except as allowed by the rules.

        (d) The action would, as part of its effect, make it IMPOSSIBLE
            to make arbitrary modifications to the rules by any
            combination of actions by persons within a four-week
            period.  Any such action CANNOT be performed.

        (e) A judicial finding states that the action is regulated.

[Specify which things are IMPOSSIBLE and which are ILLEGAL.  Block
Terrible Proposals that would allow proposal adoption within four
weeks, but not rule changes.  Allow for the possibility of non-players
participating in the process of modifying rules.]

Repeal Rule 1698 (The Proposal System Is Protected).

[Now covered by Rule 2125.]
