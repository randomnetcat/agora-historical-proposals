Amend Rule 106 by replacing:

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
      from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
      its adoption index, and then it takes effect.

      A proposal with a decision on which the option selected by Agora
      is not ADOPTED does not take effect, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

with:

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the proposal is adopted.  When a proposal is adopted,
      unless other rules prevent it from taking effect, its power is
      set to the minimum of four and its adoption index, and then it
      takes effect.  Causing a proposal to be adopted is a secured
      change; a proposal which has not been adopted does not take
      effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

Create a new Power-3 rule titled "Adoption Without Objection", with text:

      A player CAN, without objection, cause a proposal in the
      Proposal Pool to be adopted; it is then removed from the
      Proposal Pool.  To avoid "spam scams", this action cannot be
      performed unless the message of intent has exactly one Subject
      header, which must contain the exact text "[AWO]" reasonably
      close to its beginning.

[Along with actual gameplay comes the need to fix that gameplay; I
don't want to wait weeks for uncontroversial proposals to be adopted.
(Currently, it can take up to a month for a proposal to be adopted,
without any rule violations by officeholders: I submit a proposal on
Monday, the Promotor SHALL NOT distribute it until next Monday but e
waits until next Sunday; voting period is one week, and the Assessor
has one week after that to resolve the decision.  Yuch.)]
