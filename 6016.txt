The set of patent titles defined in this rule constitute the Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic; the titles may be collectively referred to as "Heroic titles" and a Bearer of a Heroic title as a Hero.

The Heroic titles in decreasing precedence are:

Grand Hero of Agora Nomic (GHAN) -- This title may be awarded to any person for the most exemplary meritorious service to Agora or to the game of Nomic at large.  As this title is the highest honour that Agora may bestow, a Bearer of this title OUGHT to be treated right good forever.

Hero of Agora Nomic (HAN) -- This title may be awarded to any person for outstanding meritorious service to Agora above and beyond the call of duty.
