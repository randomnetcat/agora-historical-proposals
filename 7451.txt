Adoption index: 3

Repeal Rule 2367 (Messy Statements).

Amend Rule 2143 (Official Reports and Duties) by replacing "inaccurate
or misleading" with "Indeterminate, inaccurate or misleading".

Amend Rule 2202 (Ratification Without Objection) by replacing
"incorrect document" with "document containing incorrect or
Indeterminate information".

Amend Rule 2381 (Win by Clout) by replacing "correct" with "correct
and Determinate".

[Fine, be that way.  Although I maintain that Fifty-Nine Thirty-Seven
was a correct fix and should have been adopted, I suppose that
Determinate and Messy Statements are fairly redundant, and there are
only a few locations in the rules that are actually affected by Messy
Statements' redefinition of "accurate" and "correct", so might as well
go to the source.]
