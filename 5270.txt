Amend Rule 402 (Identity of the Speaker) by appending this text:

      The Herald's report includes the date on which each Minister
      Without Portfolio most recently won the game.

[This information is needed when the current Speaker is removed
per Rule 1922 (e), to determine who the new Speaker is.  Tie-breaks
can be determined from the Registrar's report.]
