Amend R2154 (Election procedure) by replacing:
      Any player CAN by announcement initiate an election for an
      elected office for which no election is already in progress,
      nominating at least one active player.
with:
      Any player CAN, with Support, initiate an election for a
      specified elected office for which no election is already in
      progress.  When an election is initiated, the current holder
      of the office (if any) is initially considered to have been
      nominated and have accepted.

[Puts in a minimal with support level of control up against the
trend of beginning trivial elections.  Once started, nomination
remains by announcement; the current holder is automatically a
nominee but may decline at any time].
