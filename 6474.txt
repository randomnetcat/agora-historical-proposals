[Hopefully gets rid of R1728 loopholes once and for all.]

Amend Rule 1728 (Dependent Actions) to read:

      A rule or contract which purports to allow a person (the
      performer) to perform an action dependently (a dependent action)
      by a set of one or more of the following methods (N is 1 unless
      otherwise specified):

       1) Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer no
          greater than 8.
       2) With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer.
       3) With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1
          with a minimum of 1.
       4) With Notice.

      thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement if and
      only if all of the following are true:

       a) A person (the initiator) announced intent to perform the
          action, unambiguously and clearly specifying the action and
          method(s) (including the value of N for each method), at
          most fourteen days earlier, and (if the action depends on
          objections or notice) at least four days earlier.

       b) At least one of the following is true:

            1) The performer is the initiator.

            2) The initiator was authorized to perform the action due
               to holding a rule-defined position now held by the
               performer.

            3) The initiator is authorized to perform the action, the
               action depends on support, the performer has supported
               the intent, and the rule authorizing the performance
               does not explicitly prohibit supporters from performing
               it.

       c) Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
          other rules.

       d) If a set of conditions for the performance of the action was
          given in the announcement of intent to perform the action,
          all those conditions are met.
