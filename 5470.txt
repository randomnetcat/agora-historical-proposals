Amend Rule 591 (Inquiry Cases) by replacing this text:

      (Including a yes/no question is equivalent to including a
      statement that the answer to that question is yes.)

with this text:

      (Including a yes/no question is equivalent to including a
      statement that the answer to that question is yes, and for
      such a case, YES and NO are synonymous with the judgements
      TRUE and FALSE respectively.)
