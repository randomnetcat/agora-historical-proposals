Proposal: Card-carrying Contests

Create the following Rule, entitled Card-Carrying Contests:

   A contest may be made into a Card-Carrying Contest by its
   contestmaster acting with two support and without two objections.
   A player may only be contestmaster of one card-carrying contest
   at a time.

   A Card-Carrying Contest is a gambler, and may perform the
   following actions only as explicitly permitted by its
   regulations:
     1.  As long as the contest has at least three members and its
         hand size is less than the maximum hand size, it may draw a
         number of cards each month equal to its number of members
         at the beginning of the month divided by two and rounded up.
     2.  Transfer or discard cards.

   A Card-Carrying Contest may not play cards.
