Amend Rule 1742 (Contracts) to read:

      A contract (syn. "binding agreement") is an agreement made by
      a group of two or more persons with the intention that it be
      binding upon them and be governed by the rules.

      A contract CAN be modified, including terminating it or changing
      the set of its parties, by agreement between all parties.  A
      contract automatically terminates if the number of its parties
      falls below two.

      Parties to a contract SHALL act in accordance with it.  This
      obligation is not impaired by contradiction between the contract
      and any other contract, or between the contract and the rules.

      When a player deregisters, e ceases to be a party to all
      contracts, unless e specifies otherwise at the time, or the
      contract specifies otherwise.

Amend Rule 2136 (Contests) by appending to this text:

      A contest is an agreement that identifies itself as such, and
      identifies exactly one party as its contestmaster; all other
      parties are its contestants.

this text:

      The contestmaster of a contest CAN cease to be a party to it by
      announcement, in which case the contest terminates if it fails
      to identify a different party as the new contestmaster.
