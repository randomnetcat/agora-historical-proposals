Amend Rule 2169 (Equity Cases) by appending this text after the
first paragraph:

     For the purpose of this rule, the parties to a contract are
     measured as of the time the case was initiated; however, if
     the initiating message specifies a different time that falls
     within the week before the case was initiated, then that time
     is used instead.
