Amend Rule 2161 (ID Numbers) by replacing this text:

     (b) Such an assignment is INVALID unless the number is a natural
         number (expressed as a decimal literal with at most 14
         digits) distinct from any ID number, and greater than any
         orderly ID number, previously assigned to an entity of that
         type.  The player SHALL select the smallest number possible,
         unless e reasonably believes that selecting any smaller
         number might be invalid or confusing.

         by the rules as strictly ordered) greater than any orderly ID
         number so assigned.  The player SHOULD select the smallest
         number possible.
