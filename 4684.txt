Amend Rule 1932 to read:

      All cards with the Element "Shares [X]" are cumulatively known
      as the Stock Cards.

      An entity's Share Holdings is equal to the number of Shares
      possessed. The Number of Shares is the sum of the Share Holdings
      of all entities.

      A Shareholder is an Eligible Shareholder with positive Share
      Holdings. A Plebeian is a Player who is not a Shareholder. The
      Corporation is the set of all Shareholders.
