Amend Rule 1950 (Voting on Democratic Decisions) to read:

      The eligible voters on a democratic decision are those entities
      that, at the start of its voting period, were either

        a) active first-class players, or

        b) active partnerships with at least two first-class but
             unregistered partners who are not partners of any other
             active partnership.  The Notary SHOULD inform the Assessor
             of partnerships gaining or losing this status.

      The voting limit of each eligible voter on a democratic decision
      is one.

[Currently, no partnerships would qualify, though the PNP would have
done so at various points in its history.]
