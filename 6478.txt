Create a Power-2 rule, "Assumption of Vacant Offices", with the text:

      Assumption is an elected office switch with values Postulated
      (default) and Assumed. Changes to Assumption are secured.

      An active first-class player can make emself the holder of an
      elected office by announcement, provided that both

        (1) the office is either vacant or Assumed, and

        (2) there is no election for that office currently in progress.

      Upon doing so, the office's Assumption is flipped to Assumed.

      When the holder of an office ceases to be an active player, the
      office's Assumption is flipped to Assumed.

      When an election for an office ends with an outcome that is a
      candidate, the office's Assumption is flipped to Postulated.
