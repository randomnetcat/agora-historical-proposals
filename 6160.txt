Amend Rule 2203 (Hawkishness) by appending this text to the list of
values of Hawkishness:

     * Hovering.  Hovering players are poorly qualified to be assigned
       as judge of any inquiry case, unless there is no non-inquiry
       case requiring assignment, at least one inquiry case requiring
       assignment, and no such inquiry case with any non-Hovering
       player well-qualified to be assigned to it.
