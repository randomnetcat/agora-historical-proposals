Amend Rule 101 (The Rights of Agorans) by replacing this text:

       vi. Every person has the right to not be penalized more than
           once for any single action or inaction.

with this text:

       vi. Every person has the right to not be penalized more than
           once for any single action or inaction.  However, this
           right is not violated by replacing part or all of a penalty
           with a different but comparable penalty, e.g. when the
           rules governing penalties are amended.
