Amend Rule 1023 (Common Definitions) by appending this text to the
section defining ASAP:

       A requirement to perform an action at an exact instant (e.g.
       "when X, Y SHALL Z"), but not "in the same message", is instead
       interpreted as a requirement to perform that action in a timely
       fashion after that instant.
