Amend Rule 649 by replacing "person" with "entity" and by replacing
the entire second paragraph with:
      Awarding or revoking a Patent Title is a secured change.

Amend Rule 2162 by replacing its entire text with:

      A switch is a class of Patent Titles that the Rules define as a
      switch, and specify the following:

      a) The classes of entity to which the switch is restricted (the
         switch's range).  If an entity not in a switch's range ever
         holds a value of that switch, the value is destroyed.

      b) One or more possible values for that switch, exactly one of
         which is designated as the default.  If an entity in a
         switch's range ever does not hold a value of that switch, eir
         value of that switch is flipped to the default.

      c) Exactly one officer who tracks instances of that switch.
         That officer's report includes each value of the switch which
         is not its default value.

      A "value of a switch" is a Patent Title which refers to that
      switch and a value.  To flip an entity's value of a switch is to
      revoke all other values of that switch from em and then to award
      em a value.
