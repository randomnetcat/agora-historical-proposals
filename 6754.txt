Amend Rule 2202 by replacing the first paragraph with:
       Any player CAN, without objection, ratify a
       public document, specifying its scope. If
       that document is an official report or a substantial portion
       thereof, until such a time as that report or portion is again
       ratified, the date and scope of the ratification become a part
       of the report.
