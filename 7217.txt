Create a Power-2 rule titled "Veto and Rubberstamp":

     The Speaker CAN Veto an Ordinary decision with AI <= 3 by
     announcement; this sets its AI to 3.

     The Speaker CAN Rubberstamp an Ordinary decision with AI <= 2 by
     announcement; this sets its AI to 2, and among the
     otherwise-valid votes on a decision that has been Rubberstamped,
     only the first AGAINST vote per voter is valid.
