Zefram and Michael are co-authors of this proposal.  Goethe is a
co-author of this proposal if and only if e publically accepts it
during its voting period.

Change the power of Rule 2149 (Truthfulness) to 2, and amend it to read:

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement on a matter relevant
      to the rules that is intended to mislead others as to its truth
      (or, in the case of a public statement that one performs an
      action, its effectiveness).

      For the purpose of this rule:

        a) Merely quoting a statement does not constitute making
           that statement.

        b) Any conditional clause or other qualifier attached to a
           statement constitutes part of the statement; the nature of
           the whole is what is significant.
