Title: Cleanup in aisle 2188

Amend Rule 2188 (Win by Proposal) by replacing this text:

      Cleanup procedure: The condition cannot be satisfied again for
      the same proposal.

with this text:

      Cleanup procedure: None of those persons can satisfy the
      condition again for the same proposal.

[Brings it in line with Renaissance, where the cleanup procedure is
limited to the same "those persons" as the win clause.]
