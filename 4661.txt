provided that the Fisherman is not currently indicated by any other
'Fish your Wish' card.  If the Fisherman is already indicated by
another 'Fish your Wish' card then the playing of the card is

Fisherman's next draw is the Wish you get the card from them and get

Wish with this draw you get to draw a card for free.
