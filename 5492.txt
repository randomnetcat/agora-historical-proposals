Amend rule 2162 (Switches) to read:

      A type of switch is a class of fixed assets. An instance of a
      switch is an asset of that type of switch. In order to define
      a type of switch, the type's backing document must specify the
      following:

      a) The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch.
         Switches are restricted to these entities.

      b) One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         at most one of which is designated as the default.  No other
         values are possible for instances of that switch.

      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch.  If an instance of a
      switch comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value.
      If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a
      possible value, it comes to have its default value.

      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value.  "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.

      The report of the recordkeepor for the type of switch includes
      the value of each instance of that switch whose value is not its
      default value, or which has no default value.

      Instances of switches generally CANNOT be destroyed, except as
      defined by the backing document of the type of switch, or unless
      the instance does not belong to an entity within its restricted
      class. If an instance of a switch ever does not belong to an
      entity within its restricted class, it is immediately destroyed.
