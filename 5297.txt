Amend Rule 2110 (Win by Paradox) to read:

      If an inquiry case on the possibility of a prior or hypothetical
      rule-defined action, or the permissibility of a prior or
      hypothetical action, results in a judgement of UNDECIDABLE, and
      the judgement is not appealed within a week (or is upheld via an
      appeal decision of AFFIRM), then the initiator of the inquiry
      case wins the game by paradox if e is a player.  This can only
      occur once per inquiry case.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, root would gain the Patent Title of
Scamster, except that e already bears it.
