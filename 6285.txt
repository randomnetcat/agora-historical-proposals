Amend Rule 1030 (Precedence between Rules with Equal Power) by
appending the following paragraph:

      Any claim of precedence in a rule, including a claim of
      precedence over "all" or similarly broad classes of rules,
      is considered to be a claim of precedence over rules with
      equal power only, unless it explicitly, clearly, and
      directly claims to stipulate a means of determining
      precedence between rules of different (i.e. higher, lower,
      or otherwise unequal) power.
