Amend Rule 2125 (Regulation regulations) by replacing the text
 {
     d) The rules explicitly state that it MAY be performed while
        certain conditions are satisfied.  Except as allowed by the
        rules, performing such an action is the Class-N Crime of
        Restricted Behavior, where N is the maximum power of the
        rules explicitly allowing it (rounded up as needed to become
        a valid Class of Crime).

     e) It would, as part of its effect, modify information for which
        some player is required to be a recordkeepor.  Such an action
        CANNOT modify that information except as allowed by the
        rules.

     f) A judicial finding has determined that it is regulated, and
        has not been superseded by subsequent legislation.
