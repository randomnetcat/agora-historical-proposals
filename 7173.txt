Amend Rule 2356 (Naughtiness) to read:

      The Police Vigilance Number (PVN) is an integer tracked by the
      CotC.  Virtue is a person switch tracked by the CotC, with
      values Virtuous (default) and Unvirtuous.

      A person CAN taunt the police by announcement specifying an
      integer from 1 to 14 inclusive. Doing so makes that person
      Unvirtuous and increases the PVN by N, and is the Class-N Crime
      of Naughtiness, where N is the specified integer.

      When the PVN comes to exceed 50, all Virtuous players satisfy
      the Victory Condition of Clean Nose.

Set the Police Vigilance Number to 0.
