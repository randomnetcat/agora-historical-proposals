[Remove the penalty for failed proposals, keeping only the reward.
Although I have the feeling this is going to make Murphy win even
sooner...]

Amend Rule 2331 (Proposal Points) to read:

     When the Agoran Decision to adopt a proposal is resolved, if the
     outcome is ADOPTED, the author of the proposal gains 2  points
     for each valid vote FOR the proposal, less 1 point for each
     valid vote AGAINST the proposal. Each co-author of the proposal
     gains 2 points.
