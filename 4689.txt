Create a rule entitled "The President's Marks" with the text:

       As soon as possible after the Assessor publishes the results of
       voting on a Proposal, the President of the University shall
       publically assign a Grade to that Proposal and include with it
       an explanation of why e chose that Grade.
       
       A Grade may be any letter in the Roman alphabet between A and F,
       except E.  Each Grade is worth a number of Credits, as follows:

        * A is worth two Credits.
        * B is worth one Credit.
        * C is worth zero Credits.
        * D is worth negative one Credit.
        * F is worth negative two Credits.

       The effect of the President announcing the Grade of a Proposal
       is to add that Grade's worth to the Proposer's number of 
       Credits.  The President may only make this announcement once
       per individual Proposal.

       As soon as possible after the Turning of a New Parchment, the
       President shall award the ephemeral Patent Title of Teacher's
       Pet to the Player with the highest Credit immediately prior to
       the Turning.

       If any Player receives the Patent Title of Teacher's Pet three
       times in one Agoran year, the President shall immediately award
       em the regular Patent Title of Head of the Class.

Amend Rule 2051 (Tabla Rasa) by changing the text that reads

      (B) revoke all ephemeral Patent Titles.

to read:

      (B) revoke all ephemeral Patent Titles;

      (C) set each Player's Credit to zero.

Amend the Rule entitled "The Office of Secretary of the University" by
changing the text that reads:

      (e) The running history of all of the preceding."

with text that reads:

      (e) Each Player's number of Credits.

      (f) The running history of all of the preceding.

Upon adoption of this Proposal, all Players have zero Credits.
