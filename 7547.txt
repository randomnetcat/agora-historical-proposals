[ Make disinterested proposals harder to submit. Along with VT auctions,
this should increase the value of Yaks. This doesn't disadvantage new
players: they now get Y200 initially and Y100 a month just for voting.
That's plenty of proposals. Also the system is still based on bidding to be
in the top MI, so spending on Distributability might not even be necessary,
especially in a lull. ]

Amend Rule 2404 (Proposal Fees) by removing

      A proposal with a proposal fee of 0 is disinterested; proposals
      with positive proposal fees are interested.

Amend Rule 2405 (Distributability) by appending:

All proposals are either interested or disinterested. Disinterested
proposals CAN only be submitted without two objections.
