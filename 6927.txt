Amend Rule 2316 (Church and State) by removing:
      Upon publication of a valid notice of papal succession, the
      current Speaker ceases to be Speaker, the pope becomes the new
      Speaker, and the pope ceases to be a pope.

[Leave the pope-becoming mechanism in for future gameplay,
but remove the (broken) connection with Speaker].
