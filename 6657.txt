Amend Rule 2186 (Victory) to read:

       Winning Conditions and Losing Conditions are conditions defined
       as such by the rules.  If such a condition is defined by the
       rules as being satisfied when an event occurs (as opposed to
       being satisfied while certain other conditions hold), then it
       thereafter continues to be satisfied until the rules explicitly
       say otherwise.

       When one or more persons satisfy at least one Winning Condition
       and do not satisfy any Losing Conditions, all such persons win
       the game.  The game CANNOT be won in any other way, rules to the
       contrary notwithstanding.

       Each Winning Condition should (if needed) specify a cleanup
       procedure to prevent an arbitrary number of wins arising from
       essentially the same conditions.  When one or more persons win
       the game:

         a) For each Winning Condition satisfied by at least one of
            those persons, its cleanup procedure (if any) occurs.

         b) Each of those persons ceases to satisfy any Winning
            Conditions.

       A win announcement is a factually correct announcement
       explicitly labeled as a win announcement and/or clearly stating
       that one or more persons win the game.
