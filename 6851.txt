Adoption index: 2.0

Destroy all farads gained for authoring an adopted proposal or judging a
case and all capacitors gained for such farads since the start of this
week.

Repeal Rule 2295 "Rewards".

Amend Rule 2282 "Energy" by adding the following bullets to the list:

       (e) For each judgment on time in the last week, the judge is
       awarded
           a number of ergs equal to the Interest Index of that CFJ.

       (f) For each adopted proposal in the last week, its author is
           awarded a number of ergs equal to the Interest Index of that
           proposal.

Increase the Interest Index of the PSM by one.

[First, there are *many* unused farads and second, most players
shouldn't care much about the economy.]
