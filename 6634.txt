Amend Rule 869 (How to Join and Leave Agora) by replacing this text:

     A player CAN deregister by announcement. A person CANNOT
     register within thirty days after being deregistered by any
     means other than by a mechanism that the rules explicitly
     describe as a means of honorable deregistration.

with this text:

     A player CAN deregister by announcement.

     If a player's most recent deregistration was within the past
     four weeks, and was not via a mechanism explicitly described
     by the rules as allowing rapid return, then e CAN re-register
     without N objections (where N is the number of whole weeks that
     have elapsed since that deregistration) if N is at least 1, but
     CANNOT otherwise re-register.

[Substantive change:  players can re-register after as little as one
week if no one's bothered.  Flavor change:  eliminate the implication
that other methods of deregistration are dishonorable.]

Amend Rule 2130 (Activity) by replacing this text:

     This is a means of honorable deregistration.

with this text:

     This mechanism allows rapid return.
