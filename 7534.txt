Amend Rule 478 (Fora) by replacing:

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that no Player
      shall be prohibited from participating in the Fora.

with:

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that each player
      shall have equal access to participation in the fora.  Granting
      any set of players preferential treatment by the fora is the
      Class-14 Crime of Misdistribution.  This does not apply to
      merely having or granting access to common administrative
      functions, to applying common anti-spam measures, or to
      providing special access only to players that have requested it.

[I would never do this, but as woggle said, while we're making things
explicit...

The bit about requests is intended to allow Taral's old policy of
making officeholders request the ability to send long messages to
agora-official; although I don't think that policy is necessary, it
shouldn't be a Class-14 Crime either.]
