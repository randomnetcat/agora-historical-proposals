Amend rule 1482 by appending the text:

      No change to the Ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule
      to stipulate any other means of determining precedence between
      Rules of unequal Power.  This applies to changes by the enactment
      or amendment of a Rule, or of any other form.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule that would permit such a change to the
      Ruleset.
