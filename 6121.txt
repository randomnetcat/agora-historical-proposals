Create a new power-2 rule, called "Champion's Contests", with the
following text:
{{{
Medals are a type of asset, tracked by the Scorekeepor; ownership of
Medals is limited to contests and to non-contest players. Medals can
only be transferred, created, and destroyed as defined in this rule.

A contest's contestmaster CAN create a Medal in that contest's
possession without 2 objections. While a contest owns a Medal, it is
known as a Champion's Contest.

A contest's contestmaster CAN transfer ownership of or destroy a Medal
in that contest's possession, but only as explicitly described by the
contest's text; one exception to this is that a contest CANNOT transfer
a Medal to its contestmaster.

A Medal is automatically destroyed if the text of a contest owning it
changes.

Upon a win announcement that a specified non-contest player owns a
Medal, that player satisfies the Winning Condition of Championship.
Cleanup procedure: One Medal owned by that player is destroyed.
