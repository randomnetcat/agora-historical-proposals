Enact the following Rule:

      When a player achieves victory in BlogNomic and specifies Agora
      Nomic as their chosen theme in their Ascension Address, they
      satisfy the Victory Condition of Peaceful Invasion.

      While Agora Nomic is the theme of a BlogNomic Dynasty, players
      are ENCOURAGED to make BlogNomic proposals which would, if
      enacted, result in in-game rewards for BlogNomic players who
      register as Agoran players and perform other Agoran actions.
      Players SHALL NOT veto or vote against such proposals. In the
      week after such a proposal is adopted, its author CAN once award
      emself 30 Yaks by announcement.

      The Herald CAN and SHALL award the victor of an Agora Nomic
      themed BlogNomic Dynasty the patent title BlogNomic Champion in
      a timely manner after their victory is announced; when e does
      so, this Rule repeals itself.
