Amend Rule 2144 (Limited Partnerships) to read:

      A partnership's basis is the set containing its natural-person
      members, plus each member of the basis of each of its
      non-natural-person members.

      A partnership is prohibited from registering if its basis is
      the same as that of another registered partnership.
