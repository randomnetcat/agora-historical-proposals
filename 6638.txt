Adoption index: 2.0

Append the following text to Rule 2284 (Fee-based actions)

     - A player CAN destroy an erg in the possession of a specified
     player for a charge of 2 ergs. The PSM SHALL note such a
     destruction in eir report.

[The part about the PSM reporting the event serves to require
the PSM to not only show that 2 ergs were spent, but also
that 1 erg was destroyed.]

End Proposal

I spend one erg to make the above distributable.

Proposal: 2284 Cleanup (AI = 2, II = 0)

Change the text of Rule 2284 from "Fee-based actions" to "Fee-based Actions".
