Amend Rule 911 (Appeal Cases) by replacing this text:

      An appeal case has a judicial question on disposition, which is
      applicable if and only if the prior question is applicable.  The
      valid judgements for the question on disposition are:

      * AFFIRM, appropriate if the prior judgement was appropriate for
        the prior question

      * REMAND, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement but the judge believes
        that the judge of the prior case can make a better judgement
        if given a new opportunity

      * REASSIGN, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement

      * OVERRULE with a valid replacement judgement for the prior
        question, appropriate if the prior judgement was inappropriate
        in the prior question and the replacement judgement is
        appropriate for the prior question

      Initiation of an appeal case renders the prior question
      suspended.  It remains suspended as long as the question on
      disposition in the appeal case has no judgement.  When the
      question on disposition has a judgement, things happen according
      to that judgement:

      * if AFFIRM, the prior judgement is assigned to the prior
        question again

      * if REMAND, the prior question is rendered open again

      * if REASSIGN, the judge of the prior case (if any) is recused,
        and the prior question is rendered open again

      * if OVERRULE with a replacement judgement, the replacement
        judgement is assigned to the prior question

with this text:

      An appeal case has a judicial question on disposition, which is
      applicable if and only if the prior question is applicable.  The
      valid judgements for the question on disposition, and their
      effects, are as follows:

      * AFFIRM, appropriate if the prior judgement was appropriate for
        the prior question; the prior judgement is assigned to the
        prior question again

      * REMAND, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement but the judge believes
        that the judge of the prior case can make a better judgement
        if given a new opportunity; the prior question is rendered
        open again

      * REASSIGN, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement; the judge of the prior
        case (if any) is recused, and the prior question is rendered
        open again

      * OVERRULE with a valid replacement judgement for the prior
        question, appropriate if the prior judgement was inappropriate
        in the prior question and the replacement judgement is
        appropriate for the prior question; the replacement judgement
        is assigned to the prior question

      When an appeal case is initiated, the prior question is suspended,
      and remains so until the question on disposition in the appeal
      case is judged.
