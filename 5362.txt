Create a new rule titled "Locations", reading:

      A location is a public contract that describes itself as a
      location.  A person who becomes a party to a location is said
      to move to that location.  A person who is a party to a location
      is said to be in that location.  A person who ceases to be a
      party to a location is said to leave that location.

      A person cannot be in more than a single location at one time.
      A person who moves to a location automatically leaves any
      location e is already in.  Whenever a person's location does not
      permit em to leave it, e CANNOT move to any other location.

      The minimum number of parties for a location is zero.


Amend rule 1742 (Contracts) by replacing the text reading:

      A contract automatically terminates if the number of parties to
      it falls below two.

with:

      A contract automatically terminates if the number of parties to
      it falls below the minimum number of parties defined by the
      rules for that contract.  If not otherwise specified, the
      minimum number of parties for any contract is two.


Amend Rule 2136 (Contests) by prepending to the second paragraph the
text:

      The minimum number of parties for a contest is one.
