Create a new Rule which reads:

      Each time the Promotor distributes Proposals, e shall first
      select at random a single distributable Proposal (the Target)
      and submit an Opposite Proposal for the Target, to be
      distributed with those Proposals.

      An Opposite Proposal should be clearly marked as such.  It
      should be substantially the opposite, in spirit or effect, of
      its Target. An Opposite Proposal SHOULD have the same adoption
      index as its Target.
