Enact the following power-1 rule, titled "Dragons":

{Dragons are a class of assets. Each Dragon has exactly one color.
Colors with different names are distinct, regardless of spectral
proximity. Each color of Dragon is a currency. A Dragon may only be of
a color mentioned in this rule; if a Dragon somehow has any other
color, it becomes Gray. Ownership of Dragons is restricted to persons.

A person can, by announcement, spend one dragon of one color X and N
dragons of another color Y to gain N dragons of color X.

If e has not already done so this week, the Speaker can, by
announcement, either award a Dragon of any color to any person, or
award a Gray Dragon to every player. E SHOULD only award Dragons to
individual persons as recognition of merit appropriate to the color of
Dragon awarded.

Dragons can be Red, Orange, Green, Cyan, Blue, Black, Magenta,
Ultraviolet, Violet, Indigo, Platinum, Yellow, Silver, or Lime.

Upon a correct announcement that a specific player owns at least one
Dragon of each color, that player wins the game. (This does not cause
the game to end.) This rule then removes this paragraph from itself.}

If there is a rule titled "Ribbons", then enact the following power-1
rule, titled "Transmutation":

{If a player owns a Ribbon of a color X, then e CAN, by announcement,
cause all of their Gray Dragons to have the color X instead.}
