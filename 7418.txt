Amend Rule 2389 (Ordinary Chamber) by replacing the first paragraph with:

      VVLOP is a player switch, tracked by the Assessor, whose value
      is a non-negative integer; the default value for a player's
      VVLOP is eir DVLOP.  The voting limit of an entity on an
      Ordinary Decision is eir VVLOP.

      DVLOP is a player switch, tracked by the Assessor, whose value
      is a non-negative integer, and whose default value is four for
      first-class players and zero for second-class players.

and by replacing the paragraph containing "12 or greater" with:

      Whenever a person's VVLOP becomes 12 or greater, all VVLOPs are
      set to their default values, all VCs are destroyed, and that
      person's DVLOP is increased by 1.  If eir DVLOP would thus
      become 12 or greater, e instead satisfies the Victory Condition
      of Influence, and all DVLOPs are set to their default values.

[Yes, "influence" and "clout" are roughly the same thing, but even
someone with a DVLOP of 12 is unlikely to be able to win by clout, as
other players would also have high DVLOPs.

This removes the second-class dominance thing because I don't see the
point of it.]
