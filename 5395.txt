Create a rule titled "Pledges" with Power 1.5 and this text:

      A pledge is a contract identifying itself as such.  The
      minimum number of parties for a pledge is one.

      A pledge CAN be modified or terminated by any party without
      objection.

      An equity case regarding a pledge CAN be initiated by a
      non-party, provided that all other requirements for initiating
      an equity case are met.  The initiator of such a case is
      considered to be a party to the pledge for the purpose of
      that case.
