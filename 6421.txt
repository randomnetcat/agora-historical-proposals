Create a new Power-4 rule, entitled "Sleeping Cthulhu", with the
following text:
     At any time between 23:59 20 December 2012 and 00:01 21 December
     2012, GMT +1200, the Speaker CAN amend the entire ruleset to read
     "ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn" by
     announcement.

     If this rule would be amended or repealed by any means other than
     that specified by itself, then the change is wholly canceled and
     this rule amends the entire ruleset to read "ph'nglui mglw'nafh
     Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn".
