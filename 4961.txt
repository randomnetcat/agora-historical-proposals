Amend rule 2126 by replacing the text

      integer portion of the proposal's adoption index, and each
      co-author of the proposal gains one VC.

with

      When an Ordinary proposal is adopted, its proposer gains VCs
      equal to the integer portion of twice the proposal's adoption
      index, and each co-author of the proposal gains one VC.

[VCs are henceforth not earned for Democratic proposals, removing the
incentive to vote a Democratic proposal up or down for tactical reasons
concerning VCs.  Proposer's award is doubled, to compensate for being
applicable to fewer proposals.]

Upon the adoption of this proposal, its proposer loses the VCs that
e was (or is being, or will immediately be) awarded by the rules for
its adoption.
