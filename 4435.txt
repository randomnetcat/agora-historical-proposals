Upon the adoption of this Proposal, each Player's preferred e-mail
address(es) become listed.

Amend Rule 559 (The Registrar) by replacing "preferred" with "listed".

Amend Rule 514 (Keep the Registrar Informed of Your Address) to read:

      Each Player may list or unlist an e-mail address by informing
      the Registrar that e is doing so.  When a Player registers, the
      address used to send eir registration becomes listed.

      A listing is only valid if the Player sends a public message
      from the listed address within one week of the listing.  (This
      message may be the listing itself.)  An unlisting is only valid
      if the Player keeps at least one address listed.

      If a Player fails to notify the Registrar of a change of address,
      then the Registrar is not responsible for any e-mail that fails
      to reach that Player.

Create a Rule titled "Orange Alert" with this text:

      If a Player has no listed e-mail address, then the address used
      to send eir next public message becomes listed.

      If each Player has at least one listed address, then the Registrar
      may repeal this Rule by announcing that e does so.
