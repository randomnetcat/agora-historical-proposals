Amend Rule 2138 (The International Associate Director of Personnel)
by replacing "The Director of Personnel's report" with "The IADoP's
report".

Amend Rule 1006 (Offices) by removing this text:

               The Herald's Report shall list the holder of each office,
      and the date upon which each holder last came to hold that office.

and by replacing this text:

     If no attempt to achieve Agoran Consent for changing the holder
     of particular office is announced in a given quarter, then the
     Speaker shall make at least one such attempt to change the
     officeholder in the following quarter, and make the change if
     consent is achieved.

with this text:

     If no attempt to achieve Agoran Consent for changing the holder
     of a particular office is announced in a given quarter, then the
     IADoP shall make at least one such attempt to change the
     officeholder in the following quarter, and make the change if
     consent is acheived.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, the office of IADoP becomes held
by the Herald.
