Change the power of Rule 1698 (Agora is a Nomic) to 3.14159.
Change the power of Rule 1551 (Ratification) to 3.1.
[It is intentional that other Rules, in particular 105, remain at 3].
Amend Rule 1551 (Ratification) to read as follows:
{{
     A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.

     When a public document is ratified, the game state is modified to
     what it would be if, at the time of that document's publication,
     it had been completely true and accurate, notwithstanding that if
     that were the case, the ratification might not have occurred.
     This does not change anything retroactively, nor does it amend
     facts that are not a part of a game state or create a legal
     fiction to replace them. Players MAY, however, refer to past
     events as if the document had been completely true at the time,
     even the parts that are not a part of the game state; they SHALL
     NOT do so if there is specific need for the truth.

     All parts of a ratification occur simultaneously. No effect
     occurs indirectly due to the changes made in a ratification, as
     all such effects will have been taken into account in the
     ratification itself and repeating them would go against its
     purpose. Indirect effects may still occur based on the new state
     after the ratification is complete. If any part of a ratification
     would be unsuccessful, the remainder is unaffected and is still
     completed.

     Ratifying a public document is secured at power threshold 3.

Enact a new Rule at Power 3 entitled (Game State), with the following text:
{{
     The game state generally consists of the following:
         - All properties defined by game entities.
         - The existence and non-physical properties of entities
           defined by game entities, including the game entities
           themselves.
         - Any ongoing effects, including obligations, created by game
           entities.
     but not the following:
         - Any physical property.
         - The possibility or legality of an action that has occurred.

     A game entity is a rule or contract.

     This Rule defers to any Rule, including one of lower Power,
     insofar that it excludes or includes anything it defines, or any
     property thereof, from the game state.
}}

Amend Rule 1030 (Precedence between Rules) by replacing the first bullet
with the following
{{
     - In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule of
       higher Power takes precedence over the Rule of lower Power
       unless:
            - The Rule with the higher Power explicitly defers to the
              Rule of lower Power; and,
            - In that deferral, explicitly mentions the possibility of
              deferral to a Rule of Lower Power; and,
            - The Rule of lower Power does not explicitly defer to the
              Rule of higher Power,
       in which case the Rule of lower Power takes precedence;
       otherwise,
}}
[A better wording would be appreciated]

Amend Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) by replacing
{{
     If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
     then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
     from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
     its adoption index, and then it takes effect. It does not
     otherwise take effect.
}}
with
{{
     When an Agoran Decision to adopt a proposal is resolved with an
     outcome of ADOPTED, then the proposal is adopted, and unless
     other rules prevent it from taking effect, its power is set to
     the minimum of four and its adoption index, and then it takes
     effect. Proposals do not otherwise take effect.
}}

Amend Rule 208 (Resolving Agoran decisions) by replacing
{{
     This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
     another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.
}}
with
{{
     This rule provides the only mechanism by which an Agoran Decision
     can be resolved, and it takes precedence over any rule that would
     provide another mechanism for an Agoran Decision to be resolved.
}}
and also by replacing
{{
     (b) It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.
}}
with
{{
     (b) It clearly identifies the matter to be decided.
}}
and also by prepending the following paragrah:
{{
     Every Agoran Decision is either resolved or unresolved.
}}
[The addition of this definition should make it clear that the property
of 'resolvedness' exists within the game state and thus within the scope of
ratification.]

Amend Rule 2034 (Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges by replacing
{{
     c) (if the indicated outcome was to adopt a proposal) such a
     proposal existed, was adopted, and took effect.
}}
with
{{
     c) unless otherwise specified, that any effects directly
        associated with the resolution of that Agoran decision did or
        did not occur, as appropriate to the outcome.
}}
[This makes additional safeties; it ratifies that proposals that are
REJECTED are ratified out, that office elections are ratified, and
anything else that my arise. At the same time, it does not apply
indirectly to add safety, and it's specifically ment]

Ratify the Short Logical Ruleset published by the Rulekeepor most
immediately prior to the initial publication of this proposal to a
public forum.
