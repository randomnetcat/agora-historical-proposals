Create a rule with the following text:
Prevention of Flooding from B Nomic
{
With 2 SUPPORT, any player may be forcibly deregistered. This support may
only
come from first-class players that existed November 12, 2007. The only
players
that may be deregistered from this are those that join after November 12,
2007.
}

This only prevents new players from joining to flood B nomic. All voters
should be aware: this rule is meant to be temporary.
