Submitting a promise with an intent other than that the Promise be
given to another player or to
      the Tree as a form of binding obligation on the submitter is the
Crime of Empty Promise.

      The Crime of Empty Promise is Class 3, except when the promise
in question has empty or
      irrelevant text, or one or more conditions which are known to be
indeterminate and are unrelated
      to the game state or game play, in which case it is Class 5.
