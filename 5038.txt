Amend rule 754 by replacing each instance of "shall be interpreted as
having" with "by default has" and replacing "as shall its" with "as do
its".

[Allows for local redefinition, so that (for example) Agoran law can
interpret B Nomic's rules according to B Nomic norms, if given a
suitable mediating document that specifies the interpretational rules
to be used. Also rewording to Platonically specify what the meaning of
words is, rather than Pragmatically commanding how to interpret
documents.]
