Enact a power-2 Rule entitled "The Robot" with the text:
       There exists a person and active player called The Robot. The
       Robot CANNOT be deregistered or become inactive, rules to the
       contrary notwithstanding.

       Any first-class player (the controller) CAN in a public message
       and for a fee of N ergs, clearly designate a portion of that
       message to be a public message sent by The Robot. This is
       INEFFECTIVE if The Robot's message consists of more than N
       words, or if The Robot's message refers to another message or
       uses a contrived shorthand in an attempt to reduce the word
       count. In the latter case, the controller is also guilty of the
       Class-4 Crime of Backquoting, and the judge of a criminal case for
       that crime SHALL issue a judicial declaration as to the
       effectiveness of the message.
