Proposal:  Note the Captains

[Because current Team Wins Rules should leave permanent
recognition among past rolls of Champions, Winner's Cups,
Zeitgeists, etc.]

Amend Rule 1922 (Defined Regular Patent Titles) by appending
the following text:

      (e)  Admiral, to be awarded to a Team Captain when eir
           Team achieves a Team Win.


Upon adoption of this Proposal, any player who was a Team
Captains when eir Team previously achieved a Team win is 
awarded the title Admiral.
