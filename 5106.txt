Amend rule 1450 to read

      Any change in officeholdings that would result in a single
      entity holding the offices of promotor and assessor
      simultaneously is INVALID.  This rule takes precedence over all
      other rules regarding offices.

[Restated more simply and more strongly, and using MMI.  Dropping
Speaker/CotC mutual exclusion, because the Speaker no longer
automatically has any judicial role (should have updated that aspect
of R1450 in "judicial reform").]
