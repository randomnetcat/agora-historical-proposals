Enact a rule, entitled "Placeholder Arms," with Power 1 and the text:
 {{
Within one week after the enactment of this rule, each active
first-class player may create exactly one Flag Candidate without three
objections.  A Flag Candidate is the (non-retracted) text and title of
a Power-1 rule describing a Flag or other suitable Symbol for Agora,
and its author is known as its Flyer.

Between one and two weeks after the enactment of this rule, the Herald
CAN and SHALL initiate an Agoran decision to decide the Flag of Agora.
 The eligible voters are the active first-class players at the time
the decision is initiated, the valid options are the Flag Candidates
at the time the decision was initiated, and the vote collector is the
Herald.

The Flyer of the winning Flag Candidate satisfies the Winning
Condition of Vexillology.

Cleanup Procedure: This rule amends itself to be identical to that
Flag Candidate.
