In Rule 2150, amend the paragraph reading:

      Any biological organism that is generally capable of
      communicating by email in English (including via a translation
      service) is a person.

      Any biological organism that is generally capable of
      communicating by email in English (including via a translation
      service) is a person, though other persons may exist.
