Title: Referendum on date rewriting

The Distributor is ENCOURAGED to rewrite the Date headers in list
messages to contain the date of receipt.

[Now that I've actually given it a modicum of thought, putting a date
stamp in the Date header is essentially orthogonal to the choice
between my other two proposals (or neither, but this proposal doesn't
make much sense without one of them).  They would both make the list's
time canonical (though more squishily in the alternative case, which
would attempt to make cases where the difference matters rare), and
putting that in the Date header versus making people notice that a
particular message is timing critical and looking at the original is a
separate matter.

If this passes, we should decide whether resend-only-on-mung should be
the default always, never, or only for Gmail.]
