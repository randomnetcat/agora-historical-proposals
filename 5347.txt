Author: Murphy

Adoption index: 2

[Reserve "active" for players.  Criminal sentences are "in progress"
rather than "active".]

Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing this text:

      Some types of sentence include a duration known as the tariff.
      When a sentence with a tariff is in effect, the sentence is
      thereafter either active or not.  The sentence is inactive for
      the first week after it first takes effect.  Thereafter, the
      sentence is active if and only if it is still in effect and
      sentences of the same type on the same question on sentencing
      have been active for a total duration less than the tariff.  The
      CotC's report includes the status of all active sentences.

with this text:

      Some types of sentence include a duration known as the tariff.
      When a sentence with a tariff is in effect, the sentence is
      in progress while all of the following are true:

        a) The sentence first took effect at least one week earlier, and
           is still in effect.

        b) Sentences of the same type on the same question on sentencing
           have been in progress for a total duration less than the
           tariff.

      The CotC's report includes the status of all sentences in
      progress.

and by replacing each other instance of "active" with "in progress".

Amend Rule 2126 (Voting Credits) by replacing "a sentence becomes
active" with "a sentence becomes in progress".
