Retitle rule 103 to "Empty Throne" and amend it to read

      The office of speaker is permanently vacant.  There is no
      obligation to attempt to fill it.

[This is the ultimate development of the speaker as non-executive head
of state.  The speaker's primary role is to embody the spirit of
Agora: I can think of nothing that embodies that spirit better than a
vacant office which nevertheless can fulfill all of its duties.]

Award the patent title "Last Speaker" to the player who was speaker
immediately before this proposal was adopted.
