Amend Rule 911 by replacing the definitions of REMAND and REASSIGN with
this text:

     * REMAND, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
       appropriateness of the prior judgement; the prior question
       is rendered open again; this judgement SHOULD be assigned
       if the judge believes that the judge of the prior case will
       make a better judgement if given a new opportunity

     * REASSIGN, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
       appropriateness of the prior judgement, or if the prior judge
       exhibited corruptive self-interest (material, with a specific
       and obvious impact on eir judgement and arguments, and not
       arising merely due to a difference of opinion or a wholly
       incidental material benefit common among many players); the
       judge of the prior case (if any) is recused, and the prior
       question is rendered open again; this judgement SHOULD be
       assigned if the judge believes that the judge of the prior
       case will not make a better judgement if given a new
       opportunity
