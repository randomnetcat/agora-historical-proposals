Enact a Power=2 rule with title "Personhood" and text:

      "First-class person" means a person of a biological nature.

      "First-class player" means a player who is a first-class person.

[Logically this rule should first define "person".  In the present
form it leaves the meaning implicit, as it currently is.]

Amend rule 1728 by replacing each instance of the words "players who
are natural persons" with "first-class players".

Amend rule 1950 by replacing the text "natural person" with
"first-class person".

Amend rule 869 by replacing the text "never been a natural person"
with "never been a first-class person".
