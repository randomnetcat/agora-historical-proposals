Amend Rule 2280 (Implicit Votes) by replacing:

      e casts a number of ballots equal to eir voting limit on that
      decision.

with:

      e casts an implicit vote.  At resolution time, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding, an implicit vote is treated as if it
      were a number of identical votes equal to eir voting limit.
