Title: Fix some definitions
Author: omd
Co-authors: 
Adoption index: 3

[This makes AI/Chamber changes generally possible again, and also
fixes a current oversight (which I think is mine): adoption index is
currently only defined for decisions, but Rule 106 sets an adopted
proposal's power to its adoption index.]

Amend Rule 1950 (Decisions with Adoption Indices) by replacing the
first three paragraphs with:

     Adoption index is a switch possessed by Agoran decisions and
     proposals, whose value is either "none" (default) or an integral
     multiple of 0.1 from 1.0 to 9.9.

     Chamber is a switch possessed by Agoran decisions with adoption
     indices and proposals, with values Ordinary (default) and
     Democratic.

     Adoption index and Chamber are secured with a power threshold of
     2.

     Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
     For this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, and the
     adoption index and Chamber are initially the same as the
     corresponding values from the proposal.

Amend Rule 2350 (Proposals) to read:

     A proposal is a type of entity consisting of a body of text.  A
     player CAN create a proposal by announcement, specifying its
     text and optionally specifying the following attributes:

     * An associated title.
     * A list of co-authors (which must be persons other than the
       author).
     * An adoption index and Chamber.

     Once a proposal is created, none of its attributes can be
     changed.  The author (syn. proposer) of a proposal is the person
     who submitted it.

For each unresolved decision to adopt a proposal, set the proposal's
adoption index and Chamber to the corresponding values the decision
had before the adoption of this proposal.
