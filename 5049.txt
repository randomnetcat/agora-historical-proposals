Amend rule 2019 to read

      The Speaker may veto an Ordinary Proposal in its voting period
      by announcement.  Quorum for a vetoed proposal is positive
      infinity, other rules governing quorum notwithstanding.

      The Speaker may rubberstamp an Ordinary Proposal in its voting
      period by announcement.  Quorum for a rubberstamped proposal is
      three, other rules governing quorum notwithstanding.

[Makes the veto work in all cases, in the same manner in which
rubberstamping works.  Removes the provision about vetoed proposals
going back into the proposal pool, because under the present system it
is easy to repropose with a different AI.]

Retitle rule 2019 to "Speaker's Veto and Rubber Stamp".

[Describe both halves of the rule.]
