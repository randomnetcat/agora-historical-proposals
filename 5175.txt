Create a rule titled "Grandfather Appeals" with this text:

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in a non-appeal
      case, other than an assignment caused by a judgement in an appeal
      case, CAN be initiated by any player with 2 support.

      At midnight UTC on October 1, 2007, this rule repeals itself.

[A final grace period for those of us who were tripped up by the new
two-week deadline for appealing a judgement.  I would like to appeal
CFJs 1697 and 1700; root, I'll support yours as well if this passes.]
