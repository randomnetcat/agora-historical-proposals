Amend rule 2126 by replacing the text "When one or more players win
the game" with "When a game win occurs".

Amend rule 1922 by replacing the text "any player who wins the game"
with "any person who wins the game".

[This doesn't actually allow a non-player to win, because each win
method is still restricted to players.  This just sets things up for
non-player wins to have the usual effect, once we allow them.  We're
generally allowing non-players to take more game actions, such as
calling for judgement (since CFJ 888) and entering into contracts and
partnerships.  The NomicWiki has a new category "ExtendedStatus" for
nomics that do this sort of thing.  There's no particular reason to
restrict winning.]
