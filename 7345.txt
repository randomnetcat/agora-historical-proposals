Adoption index: 3.0

Set the power of rule 2357 to 3.

Amend Rule 2357 by replacing "The eligible voters on" with "Rules to
the contrary notwithstanding, the eligible voters on".

[Current R1950 defines the eligible voters for all decisions with
adoption indices at power 3, making R2357's attempt to do so for
Gerontocratic decisions ineffective.]
