Proposal:  Fi Fo Fum Fees

Amend Rule 1941 to read:

      If the Rules associate a non-negative cost, price, charge, or
      fee with an action, that action is a fee-based action.  If the
      specified cost is not an integer, the actual fee is the next
      highest integer.

      To perform a fee-based action, a Player (the Actor) who is
      otherwise permitted to perform the action must announce that e
      is performing the action and announce that there is a fee for
      that action.  Upon said announcement, the action is performed,
      the Actor's kudos are decreased by the fee, and Agora's kudos
      are increased by the fee.

      Any Player (hereafter the challenger) may announce that the
      Actor possessed insufficient Honor (kudos) to perform the
      action, provided e issues eir challenge within 7 days of the
      attempted action.

      As soon as possible after such a challenge, the Herald shall
      confirm or deny whether the Actor possessed kudos equal to or
      greater than the fee at the time e attempted the action.
      If the Actor in fact possessed insufficient honor, or the honor
      of the Actor cannot be determined by reasonable effort, the action
      shall be deemed to have not occurred and the kudos of the Actor
      (and Agora) shall be deemed to have not been changed by the fee.

      If a Player issues a challenge as above, but more than 7 days
      have passed since the attempted action, then the action shall be
      permitted to stand.  As soon as possible after a late challenge
      is issued, the Herald shall confirm or deny its correctness.
      But in this case the Fee shall be recorded even if the Actor is
      left with negative kudos.
