Amend Rule 2143, "Official Reports and Duties", to read:

      For each person:

      a) If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
          weekly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each
          week, except if the Speed is Slow, in which case the duties
          SHALL be completed once each fortnight.  If any information
          is defined by the rules as part of that person's weekly
          report, then e SHALL maintain all such information, and the
          publication of all such information is part of eir weekly
          duties.

      b) If any task is defined by the rules as part of that person's
          monthly duties, then e SHALL perform it at least once each
          month.  If any information is defined by the rules as part
          of that person's monthly report, then e SHALL maintain all
          such information, and the publication of all such
          information is part of eir monthly duties.

      Any information defined by the rules as part of a person's
      report, without specifying which one, is part of eir weekly
      report.  Failure of a person to perform any duty required of em
      within the allotted time is the Class-2 crime of Tardiness.

      While performing weekly or monthly duties or publishing weekly
      or monthly reports, persons SHALL NOT publish information that
      is inaccurate or misleading.

      Reports SHALL be published in plain text.  Tabular data must

      report that deviates from these regulations is the Class 2 Crime
