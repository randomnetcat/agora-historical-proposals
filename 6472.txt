Amend Rule 2226 (Judicial Rank) by replacing this text:

      A player CAN flip eir judicial rank to any value by
      announcement.

      When a judgement is overruled on appeal, if the prior judge's
      rank is higher than 0, then it is decreased by 1, and e CANNOT
      increase it for 30 days afterward (the rest of this rule
      notwithstanding), unless eir new rank is 0, in which case e CAN
      increase it to 1 at any time with 3 support.

      "District", "Circuit", and "Supreme" are synonymous with
      judicial ranks 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
