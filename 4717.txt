      aborted, and the copy of it that is added to the proposal pool due
      to the abortion becomes democratic and distributable.

Amend Rule 1965 (Complacent Corporation) by replacing this text:

      a proposal, the proposal is immediately aborted.  In addition,
      the copy of the proposal that is added to the proposal pool as a
      result of the abortion becomes democratic and distributable.

      When the Assessor publishes a Notice of Complacency for a
      proposal, it becomes extraordinary.

Amend Rule 2019 (The Speaker's Veto) to read:

      the Speaker may veto that proposal with the support of one-third
      of all shareholders, rounded down.  When e does so, the proposal
      becomes extraordinary.
