Repeal every rule (in numerical order) that, in the most recent
publication of the FLR prior to the publication of this proposal, was
in the Contract Law category.

Repeal Rule 2169 (Equity Cases).
Repeal Rule 2145 (Partnerships).
Enact a new Rule with power 3:
{{
For greater certainty, no entity is a contract for the purposes
of Rules.
}}
[This prevents people from abusing real-law contracts in the remaining
rules that refer to them, since I'm too lazy and busy to amend those
rules appropriately.]
