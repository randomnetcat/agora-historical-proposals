Create a new rule titled "Voting Credits" of Power 3 with the  
following text, delimited by '---'.
---
Voting Credits (VCs) are a measure of each player's ability to affect  
voting limits on ordinary proposals.  A player's VC is at all times a  
non-negative integer.  The Promotor is the recordkeepor of VCs.  VCs  
are not any form of property and cannot be traded.  VCs can be  
affected only as described in this rule.

When one or more players win the game, all players' voting limits on  
ordinary proposals are reset to one, subject to modification by other  
rules.

When a player joins Agora, eir VCs are set to zero.

When a proposal is adopted, its proposer gains VCs equal to the  
integer portion of the proposal's adoption index, and each co-author  
of the proposal gains one VC.

A player may expend two VCs to increase eir own voting limit on  
ordinary proposals by one.

A player may expend one VC to increase any other player's voting  
limit on ordinary proposals by one.

A player may expend two VCs to decrease any other player's voting  
limit on ordinary proposals by one, down to a minimum voting limit of  
zero.  Attempts to decrease a player's voting limit on ordinary  
proposals below this minimum fail.

If a player attempts to expend more VCs than e currently has, the  
action fails, and the VCs are not expended.

The Promotor may accept reasonable synonyms for "expend" (such as  
"pay" or "use") as valid actions under this rule.

Upon adoption of this proposal, each player's VCs are set to two.
