Amend Rule 911 (Appeal Cases) by replacing this text:

      * REASSIGN, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement; the judge of the prior
        case (if any) is recused, and the prior question is rendered
        open again

with this text:

      * REASSIGN, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement, or if the prior judge
        exhibited corruptive self-interest (material, with a specific
        and obvious impact on eir judgement and arguments, and not
        arising merely due to a difference of opinion or a wholly
        incidental material benefit common among many players); the
        judge of the prior case (if any) is recused, and the prior
        question is rendered open again
