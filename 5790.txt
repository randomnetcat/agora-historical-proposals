Amend Rule 2150 (Personhood) by replacing this text:

     Any biological organism that is capable of communicating by
     email in English is a person.

with this text:

     Any biological organism that is generally capable of
     communicating by email in English (including via a translation
     service) is a person.

[Temporary lack of email access does not entail loss of personhood.]
