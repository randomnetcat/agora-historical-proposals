Amend Rule 2126 (Notes) by replacing this text:

      (8) A player CAN spend three Notes to gain a Note whose pitch
          is as many semitones distant from one of the Notes spent
          as the distance between the other two Notes spent.

with this text:

      (8) A player CAN spend two notes (hereafter X and Y) to gain a
          note whose pitch is as many semitones above the pitch of Y
          as Y is above the pitch of X.

      (9) A player CAN spend three Notes (hereafter X, Y, and Z) to
          gain a Note whose pitch is as many semitones above the pitch
          of Z as Y is above the pitch of X.

[The old #8 and new #9 is my mis-remembered version of Zefram's
idea; the new #8 is eir original idea.]
