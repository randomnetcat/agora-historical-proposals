Enact a new power-2 Rule entitled "Chamber of Commerce" reading:
      The Chamber of Commerce is the Agoran hub of ideas and people and
      is, naturally enough, a Chamber. All proposals are welcome in the
      Chamber of Commerce, provided that the submitter pays the
      Application Fee when submitting the proposal. Entrepreneurial
      Agorans are ENCOURAGED to apply their proposals to the Chamber of
      Commerce in order to accumulate more capital, more connections,
      and as a result increase their business' success in the long term.

      The Chamber of Commerce uses state-of-the-art modern democratic
      processes to vote on Decisions. The voting limit of any entity
      (anyone is welcome to participate in the deliberations of the
      Chamber) on a Decision in the Chamber of Commerce is the square
      root of the number of Yaks e held at the start of its voting
      period. If you think that this might be a little daunting, don't
      worry; every time that a decision is initiated in the Chamber of
      Commerce, the Yak Herdor is ENCOURAGED to list all the voting
      limits of everyone so that nobody is confused or left wanting.

      Remember, the Chamber of Commerce is about YOU and your success.
      You MAY be able to do well on your own, but if you leverage the
      knowledge, expertise, and experience of your fellows in the
      Chamber of Commerce, you CAN usher in a bright future both to
      Agora and to your bottom line.
