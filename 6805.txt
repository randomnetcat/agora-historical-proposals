Amend Rule 2287 by replacing the text:

        Once per week, each player CAN transfer a prop from one player
        to another, provided that e explains why e chose each player,
        and does not transfer it to emself.

with:

        Any player CAN, by announcement, transfer a prop from one player
        to another, provided that e explains why e chose each player,
        and does not transfer it to emself. E CANNOT do so with a player
        other than emself as the giving player more than once per week.

        At the beginning of each Agoran Week, two props are destroyed in
        the possession of each player who did not transfer one of their
        props to another player in the previous week. If such a player
        does not posseses two props, all of eir props are destroyed.
