Amend Rule 2203 (Hawkishness) to read as follows:
       Hawkishness is a player switch, tracked by the Clerk of the
       Courts, with the following values:

       * Hanging.  Hanging players are unqualified to be assigned as
         judge of any inquiry case.

       * Hugging.  Hugging players are unqualified to be assigned as
         judge of any criminal case.

       * Hemming-and-Hawing (default).

       * Hovering.  Hovering players are poorly qualified to be
         assigned as judge of any inquiry case, unless there is no
         non-inquiry case requiring assignment, at least one inquiry
         case requiring assignment, and no such inquiry case with any
         non-Hovering player well-qualified to be assigned to it.

       Changes to hawkishness are secured.

       A player CAN flip eir hawkishness by announcement.
