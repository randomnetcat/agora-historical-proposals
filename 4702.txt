Proposal:  Simple free distribution

Amend Rule 1952 by replacing the text:
      A player may flip a proposal's depth to distributable by paying
      a fee equal to its Distribution Cost, or to undistributable by
      paying a fee equal to twice its Distribution Cost.

with:
      A player may flip the depth of a Proposal that e proposed to
      distributable by paying a fee equal to its Distribution Cost.

      A player may flip the depth of a Proposal that e did not
      propose to distributable by paying a fee equal to its
      Distribution Cost minus one (minimum zero).

      A player may flip the depth of any Proposal to undistributable
      by paying a fee equal to twice its Distribution Cost.
