Amend Rule 754 by replacing:
     (2) A term explicitly defined by the Rules by default has that
         meaning, as do its ordinary-language synonyms not explicitly
         defined by the rules.
with:
     (2) A term explicitly defined by the Rules by default has that
         meaning when used in any Rule of equal or lesser power, as
         do its ordinary-language synonyms not explicitly defined by
         the rules.

and by appending the following sentence to the paragraph labeled (4):

     In determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term,
     definitions contained in lower-powered Rules, followed
     by definitions used in contracts or other Agoran legal
     documents, SHOULD be used for guidance.
