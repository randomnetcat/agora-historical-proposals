Amend Rule 2152 by appending the following text to the first paragraph:

     Where these terms are used with reference to an entity having a
     certain state, they apply to the action of a person causing it
     to have that state.

[The fix in 6919 is incomplete.  Since only SHOULDs would be affected
by this, though, the delay between 6919 passing (if it does) and this
isn't a big deal.]
