Amend Rule 2023 (Submitting a CFJ to the Justiciar) to read:

      A CFJ may be submitted to the Justiciar, instead of to the Clerk
      of the Courts, if it is explicitly marked as such.  For such a
      CFJ, all duties/roles that would otherwise be performed/filled
      by the Clerk of the Courts shall instead be performed/filled by
      the Justiciar.  This rule takes precedence over rules that would
      otherwise assign duties and roles regarding a CFJ to the Clerk
      of the Courts.

      All persons are encouraged to submit a CFJ to the Justiciar only
      when there is a good reason not to submit it to the Clerk of the
      Courts.
