Amend Rule 2161 to read:
      If a rule defines a type of entity as having ID numbers, then:

      (a) Whenever an entity of that type does not have an ID number,
          the person held responsible by that rule SHALL assign an ID
          number to it by announcement as soon as possible.  This ID
          number SHALL be orderly, unless the person reasonably
          believes that assigning an orderly ID number would
          excessively inflate the set of orderly ID numbers of
          entities of that type.

      (b) An orderly ID number is a natural number (expressed as a
          decimal literal with at most 14 digits) distinct from any ID
          number, and greater than any orderly ID number previously
          assigned to an entity of that type.  When a person assigns
          an orderly ID number, e SHALL select the smallest number
          possible, unless e reasonably believes that selecting any
          smaller number might be invalid or confusing.  All other ID
          numbers are chaotic.

      (c) Once assigned, an ID number cannot be changed.

      (d) If an office is responsible for assigning ID numbers, then
          that officer's report includes the greatest orderly ID
          number, and a list of all chaotic ID numbers previously
          assigned to the type of entity.
