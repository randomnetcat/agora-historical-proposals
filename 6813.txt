Amend Rule 2230 by replacing:

        When a NoV becomes Closed, a number of Rests are created in the
        possession of the Accused equal to the Class of the specified
        Crime, or in its absence the Power of the violated rule, rounded
        up.

with:

        When an NoV becomes Closed, a number of Rests is created in the
        possession of the Accused equal to two plus the Class of the
        specified Crime, where, if a Crime has no defined Class, its
        Class is considered to be the Power of the violated rule,
        rounded up.

[2 additional Rests for each Crime, because players should not think
violation is ok, only because destroying a single Rest is not
expensive.]
