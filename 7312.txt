Enact the following Rule, Win by Clout, Power-1.7:

      If a single Player has a voting limit on an Agoran Decision
      that has a Chamber, and that voting limit, at the end of the
      Decision's voting period, is greater than the combined voting
      limits of all other entities on that decision, that player
      satisfies the Victory Condition of Clout.

      If a correct Victory Announcement is made for such a win, this
      Victory Condition ceases to be a Victory Condition for Decisions
      in the same Chamber for 21 days following the announcement.
