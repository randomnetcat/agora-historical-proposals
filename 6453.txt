Replace the entire text of Rule 2224 (Interest Index of Proposals) with:

      Each proposal has an interest index, which CAN be set by its
      author at the time of submission, and CAN be changed (while
      undistributed) by any player without 2 objections, or by the
      Promotor or Assessor without 3 objections.

      A proposal SHOULD be disinterested if and only if its effects
      are limited to correcting errors and/or ambiguities.
