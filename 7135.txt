Amend Rule 2343 (Victory Cases) by changing its title to
"Victory Conditions" and amending it to read:

         A Victory Condition is a condition explicitly defined by the
         rules as a victory condition.  A Victory Announcement is a
         published statement labeled as a Victory Announcement that
         states clearly that a specified person or persons have
         satisfied a specified and rules-defined victory condition
         (and explicitly and clearly states which persons and which
         victory condition).  A Victory Announcement is self-ratifying.

         When a Victory Announcement ratifies, or a judgement
         confirming the veracity of a victory announcement has been in
         effect and unappealed for one week, and provided the person(s)
         named have not already won via the same events, the person(s)
         Win the Game.  There is no other method of winning the game.
         Winning the game does not cause Agora to end.

         The Herald SHALL award the Patent Title Champion to any
         person who wins the game, as soon as possible after the win.
         The Herald SHOULD note the method of winning in eir report.

         Any person who wins the game while knowingly breaking a Rule,
         or while willingly and knowingly being a party to a Rules
         breach, where the breach is directly and substantially
         responsible for the win, commits the Class-4 Crime of Poor
         Sportsmanship.  If any party is found GUILTY of this crime,
         then, as soon as possible after the judgement has been in
         effect for one week, the Herald SHALL, as part of the
         punishment, revoke any Champion title awarded to the guilty
         parties as a result of the win.

[Note:  for pragmatism, a criminal win remains a "win" but with e
different patent title and punishment].
