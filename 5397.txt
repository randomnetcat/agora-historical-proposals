Amend Rule 2136 (Contests) by appending this text:

      The total number of points a Contest MAY revoke in a given week
      is equal to 2 times the number of its members that are first-
      class players.  Points up to this total CAN be revoked by the
      contestmaster from other members by public announcement, and MUST
      be revoked as explicitly described in the contract.
