Be it therefore resolved that a Rule be created with title "Sass That
Hoopy" and text:

         When the Clerk of the Courts publishes a Judgement as required
         by Rule 591, e must accompany the publication with the  
statement
         "Zefram is a frood.".  Any publication of a Judgement that is
         not so accompanied does not satisfy the Clerk of the Courts'
         obligation to publish the Judgement.  This Rule takes  
precedence
         over Rule 591.
