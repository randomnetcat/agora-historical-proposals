Amend rule 2162 by replacing the paragraph

      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value.  "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.

with

      To "flip" an instance of a switch to a particular value is to
      make that switch come to have that value (regardless of what the
      switch's value was previously).  To "become X", where X is a
      possible value of exactly one of the subject's switches, is to
      have that switch change value to X from some other value.

["Become" refers to a change in switch value, not the action of
changing it (which is what "flip" is).  Explicate for both definitions
whether a null change counts.]
