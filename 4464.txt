Amend Rule 594 by deleting the text reading:

       The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
       requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
       that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

Create a Power-3 Rule titled "Adoption Indices", reading:

       1) The Default Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of:

          a) 1; and
          b) any minimum values required for that Proposal by the Rules.


       2) The Proposer of a Proposal may, at the time when e submits the
          Proposal or at any time while it is in the Pool, request an
          Adoption Index for that Proposal by announcement, specifying the
          requested value.


       3) When a Proposal is distributed, its Adoption Index is set to
          the maximum of:

          a) its Default Adoption Index; and
          b) any values requested by its Proposer as permitted in 2).


       4) This is the only mechanism for setting or changing the Adoption
          Index of a Proposal.  This Rule takes precedence over Rules that
          would allow other mechanisms for setting or changing the Adoption
          Index of a Proposal.
