Amend rule 2126 by appending to the list of ways that VCs can be
gained and lost the new items

      (+V) When a person is awarded a patent title, e gains one violet
           VC, unless e gained a VC in this way earlier in the same
           month.

      (-V) When a person has a patent title revoked from em, and the
           instrument that authorises the revocation does not describe
           the revocation as administrative, e loses one violet VC.

      (+I) When a person is awarded a patent title that is a degree, e
           gains a number of indigo VCs.  The number depends on the
           rank of the degree: it is two for the lowest rank, four for
           the next, and so on increasing by two per rank, up to a
           maximum of twelve for the sixth and higher ranks.  If the
           rank of the degree is not adequately defined to apply this
           rule then the number is two.
