Amend R2136, "Contests", by replacing the text:

     A player with 100 or more points may win the game by announcing
     this fact.  Upon such an announcement, each player's score is
     set to zero.

With the text:

     A player with 100 or more points may announce this fact.  If this
     announcement is correct, then the following events happen:

      1.  The announcing player wins the game.
      2.  Each player's score is set to zero.

(It's been good practice in the past to qualify such announcements  
with the condition that the announcement be correct.  See previous  
versions of the Notice of Speaker Rotation a few years ago.)
