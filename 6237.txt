Title: Fix veto

Adoption index: 3.0

Change the Power of Rule 2019 (Prerogatives) to 3, and amend it by
replacing:

      c) Wielder of Veto.  The Wielder of Veto CAN veto an ordinary
         decision in its voting period by announcement; this increases
         its Adoption Index by 1.

with:

      c) Wielder of Veto.  The Wielder of Veto CAN veto a decision
         with an adoption index in its voting period by announcement.
         The adoption index of a decision that has been vetoed is one
         more than it would otherwise be, rules to the contrary
         notwithstanding.

[Veto is currently broken, because Rule 106 (Power=3), which defines
the adoption index of a proposal, takes precedence over Rule 2019
(Power=2); it's also unclear what happens to a decision without an
adoption index.  This fixes these problems and also strengthens veto
somewhat.]
