Amend Rule 1567 (Making Oneself Ineligible to Judge a CFJ) by
appending, after this text:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ or type of CFJ by informing the Clerk of the Courts that e
      does so.  Such a notice remains in effect for one month, or
      until the Player informs the Clerk of the Courts that it is no
      longer in effect, whichever is soonest.

the following text:

      A request identifying all CFJs within a time period shall be
      interpreted as referring to all CFJs called within that period.

[So if you really mean "I request to be ineligible to judge all CFJs;
this request becomes ineffective after two weeks", then say so!]
