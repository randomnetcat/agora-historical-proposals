Amend Rule 2019 (Prerogatives) by replacing the first
paragraph with:

     In a timely fashion before the beginning of each month, the
     Speaker SHALL assign each prerogative to a different active
     player; first assigning prerogatives to active players bearing
     the Patent Title Minister without Portfolio (MwoPs); then (if
     there are more prerogatives than active MwoPs), assigning
     prerogatives to other active players.
