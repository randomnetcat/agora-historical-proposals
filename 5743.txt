      In Rule 478, replace:

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously
      specifying the action and announcing that e performs it.  Any
      action performed by sending a message is performed at the time
      date-stamped on that message.

      with:

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously
      specifying the action and eir identity, and announcing that e performs
      it.  Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the
      time that message was sent to a public forum.


[Would require an unambiguous specification of identity so that "I am
a current player" sent anonymously wouldn't work.  Also generalizes to
when message was sent instead of specifying the date stamp, which
follows current precedent (the "Date:" header is usually accepted as
the time an action occurred unless it's clearly lying, in which case
an appropriate Received: header is used; I believe this wording more
accurately reflects our practice, which arguably violates the letter
of the rule if we don't currently allow forged Date: headers to
control timing. At best, "time date-stamped" is ambiguous since every
message has multiple times stamped on it by various machines.)]
