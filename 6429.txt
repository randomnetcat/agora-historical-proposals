Amend Rule 2240 (No Cretans Need Apply) to read:

      In a conflict between clauses of the same Rule, if exactly one
      claims precedence over the other, then it takes precedence;
      otherwise, the later clause takes precedence.

[This not only generalizes the rule, but also changes the direction of
its application, on the assumption that "X, but Y" is more common.]
