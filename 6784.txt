Amend Rule 2161 by removing bullets (c) and (e) from the list, and
relettering the rest accordingly, and amending bullet (b) to read
       (b) Such an assignment is INVALID unless the number is a natural
           number (expressed as a decimal literal with at most 14
           digits) distinct from any ID number previously assigned to
           an entity of that type, and ILLEGAL unless the number is
           one greater than the greatest ID number so assigned.
