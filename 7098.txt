["Believe" shouldn't be in the rules; let anyone initiate the case;
allow appealing by announcement like in criminal cases.]

Amend Rule 2343 (Victory Cases) by replacing the text up to "The
entities eligible" with the following paragraph:

     Victory cases are a subclass of judicial cases. Any person CAN
     initiate a victory case by announcement, specifying a person
     (the Enlaureled) that allegedly satisfied a Victory Condition,
     the Victory Condition allegedly satisfied, and the means by
     which it was allegedly satisfied.

and by replacing "the caller is deemed" with "the Enlaureled is
deemed", and by appending the following paragraph:

     An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in a victory
     case within the past week CAN be initiated by the Enlaureled by
     announcement.
