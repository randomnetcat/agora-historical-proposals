Amend Rule 1871 (The Standing Court) by replacing this text:

      The CotC CAN rotate the bench (change all sitting players to
      standing) by announcement, but SHALL NOT do so unless there is a
      judicial case to which e is obliged to assign a judge, all
      entities qualified to be so assigned are poorly qualified, and e
      immediately afterwards (in the same announcement) assigns a
      judge to that case.

with this text:

      The CotC CAN rotate the bench (change all sitting players to
      standing) by announcement, but SHALL NOT do so unless, of the
      judicial cases requiring assignment:

        a) no entity is well-qualified to be assigned to any of them;

        b) e immediately afterwards (in the same announcement) assigns
           a judge to at least one of them.
