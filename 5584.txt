Adoption index: 2

Repeal rule 2153.

In rule 1607, amend "its interest index" to
{{{
whether it is disinterested or interested (it is disinterested if and
only if its proposer said it was in the message that submitted it, and
otherwise interested).
}}}

Remove paragraph 5 of rule 2126.

Replace paragraph d of rule 2192 with this:
{{{
      d) Submit a disinterested proposal, with adoption index equal to
         the Power of the selected rule, to append the modified text
         to the rule "The Monster" (or, if the villagers have shown up
         with torches and pitchforks, to repeal both that rule and this
         one).  This proposal counts as the Mad Scientist's weekly
         report if/when it is adopted.
