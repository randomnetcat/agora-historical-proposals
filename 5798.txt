[Ratification has been the source of scams lately.  Too much traffic
to check all reports well.  Thus, some safety.  Require a supporter
as a way of saying "yes I also think ratification is needed and I've
looked at the report too".  Also, note that ratification used to be
much rarer without breaking the game]

Amend R2202 to be titled "Official Ratification"

Amend R2202 by replacing "without objection" with "without objection
and with support".

Append the following sentence to R2202:
    A player SHALL NOT ratify nor support the ratification
    of a report e knows to be false.
