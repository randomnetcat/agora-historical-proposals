        The Promotor CAN distribute an Urgent Proposal as soon as it
        becomes Distributable, and e SHALL do so within four
        days unless it becomes undistributable in the mean time.

        The Assessor SHALL make a reasonable attempt to resolve a
        decision to adopt an urgent proposal within 4 days of its
        voting period ending.  Failure to meet these deadlines is
