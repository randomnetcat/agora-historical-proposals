Amend Rule 2343 (Victory Conditions) by replacing the first paragraph with:

     Victory Conditions and Losing Conditions are conditions
     explicitly defined as such by the Rules.  Such conditions are
     generally satisfied instantaneously, not continuously.

     A Victory Announcement is a published statement labeled as a
     Victory Announcement that states clearly that a specified person
     or persons have satisfied a specified Victory Condition while
     not satisfying any Losing Conditions (and explicitly and clearly
     states which persons and which victory condition).  A Victory
     Announcement is self-ratifying.

Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by appending after "CANNOT register
for two months after that time.":

     During this period, e is known as a Fugitive.  Being a Fugitive
     is the Losing Condition of Seeking Asylum.
