Create a rule titled "The Mad Scientist" with this text:

      The Mad Scientist is an office; its holder is responsible for
      building the Monster.

      At least once each week, the Mad Scientist SHALL:

        a) Randomly select exactly one rule.  If the selected
           rule is either this rule or the rule "The Monster",
           then the villagers have shown up with torches and
           pitchforks; skip directly to proposal submission.

        b) Select one or more contiguous sentences from the
           selected rule.

        c) Select exactly one noun from the selected text, and
           replace each instance of that noun with "Monster"
           (including grammatical variations, e.g. replacing
           "<noun>'s" with "Monster's").

        d) Submit a proposal, with adoption index equal to the
           Power of the selected rule, and interest index 0, to
           append the modified text to the rule "The Monster"
           (or, if the villagers have shown up with torches and
           pitchforks, to repeal both that rule and this one).
