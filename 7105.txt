Enact a new power-2 Rule entitled "Vote Cards" with the following text:

     Vote Cards are a class of assets and a currency, tracked by the
     Assessor. Ownership of Vote Cards is restricted to players.

     Players CAN, as a Spending Action, create a Vote Card in their
     possession, provided that they do not own more than 20 Vote
     Cards. Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, Vote Cards CANNOT
     be transferred to a player who owns 20 or more Vote Cards.
     Players CAN, as a Spending Action, destroy a Vote Card in the
     possession of a specified player.

     At the beginning of each week each active player who owns more
     than one vote card has one destroyed; each inactive player loses
     two vote cards regardless of the number they own.

     The voting limit of an eligible voter on an ordinary decision is
     the number of Vote Cards they own divided by the adoption index
     of the decision (fractions rounded towards the nearest odd
     number).

     A player who owns no Vote Cards and has not already done so in
     the same month CAN create one in eir possession by announcement.

Enact a new power-2 Rule entitled "Support Democracy"

     A player CAN, with three support, make a specified ordinary
     decision in its voting period democratic.

Set the base cost of creating a vote card to 10.
Set the base cost of destroying a vote card to 15.
