with this text:

       A variation in whitespace, capitalization, or substitution of
       section labels with the same ordinal position (e.g. 1 / a / i,
       2 / b / ii, etc.) in the quotation of an existing rule does not
       constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this rule, but any other
       variation does.
