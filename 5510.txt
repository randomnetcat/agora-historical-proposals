Zefram is a co-author of this proposal (he suggested the idea behind
#8 a long while back IIRC).

Amend Rule 2126 (Notes) by appending this text to the list of ways to
spend Notes:

      (6) A player CAN spend one Note to increase another player's
          voting limit on an ordinary proposal whose voting period is
          in progress by 1.

      (7) A player CAN spend two Notes to increase eir voting limit
          on an ordinary proposal whose voting period is in progress
          by 1.

      (8) A player CAN spend three Notes to gain a Note whose pitch
          is as many semitones distant from one of the Notes spent
          as the distance between the other two Notes spent.
