Create a rule titled 'Making Wagers' with the following text:

       A Wager is an announcement specifying the following:

         (a) A statement that is, or will become, true or false,

         (b) The number and color of Marks being wagered, which MUST be
             less than or equal to the number of Marks possessed by that
             player, and

         (c) The outcome wagered on by the offering player.

       Any other player with Marks greater than or equal to the amount
       of the Wager CAN accept it by announcement, unless the Wager has
       already been accepted.  E thereby wagers on the opposite outcome
       from that wagered on by the offering player.

Create a rule titled 'Resolving Wagers' with the following text:

       A Wager MAY be resolved when the following conditions are met:

         (a) The Wager has been accepted, and

         (b) The statement that is the subject of the Wager is either
             true or false.

       An accepted Wager CAN be resolved by a correct announcement
       specifying the truth value of the statement, which must be
       exactly one of true or false.

       As soon as possible after a Wager is resolved the player who
       wagered on the incorrect outcome MUST transfer the agreed number
       and color of Marks to the player who wagered on the correct
       outcome.
