Title: Reserve Fora

Adoption index: 2.0

So that no player sends an announcement in the reserve fora (which many
will likely not receive because nobody pays attention to the reserve
fora) in lieu of the commonly used public fora, this proposal creates a
new class of fora.

Amend the paragraph in Rule 478 (Fora) reading

      Publicity is a forum switch with values Public, Discussion, and
      Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.

to read:

      Publicity is a forum switch with values Public, Reserve,
      Discussion, and Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.

Amend the paragraph in Rule 478 (Fora) reading

      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or sent
      to all players and containing a clear designation of intent to
      be public.  A person "publishes" or "announces" something by
      sending a public message.

to read:

      A public message is a message sent via a public forum, or, if
      the sender reasonably believes no public forum to be available
      and functional, sent via a reserve forum or directly all players
      containing a clear designation of intent to be public.
