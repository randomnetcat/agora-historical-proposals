[I believe that the adoption index and chamber of all proposals and
decisions are presently in my weekly report.]

Amend Rule 2139 (The Registrar) by replacing:

      The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches that
      would otherwise lack an officer to track them.

with:

      The Registrar is also responsible for tracking any switches that
      would otherwise lack an officer to track them, unless the switch
      is defined as untracked.

Amend Rule 1950 (Decisions with Adoption Indices) by replacing "a
switch" with "an untracked switch" in the first two paragraphs.
