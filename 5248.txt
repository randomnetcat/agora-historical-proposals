      When a player is poorly qualified to be assigned as judge of a
      judicial case, the Clerk of the Courts SHALL not assign em to be
      the judge of that case; if e has done so, and that player is still
      the judge of that case, then e CAN recuse that judge from that
      case by announcement.

      the judge of any judicial case.  If the CotC has assigned a
      sitting player as judge, and that player is still the judge of
      that case, the CotC CAN recuse that judge from that case by
      announcement.

                      A sitting player is poorly qualified to be
      assigned as judge of any judicial case.
