Create a new Power-3 rule reading:

     When an eligible voter on an Agoran decision attempts to cast
     ballots without explicitly specifying the number of ballots to
     be cast (e.g. "FOR" instead of "FOR*1" or "FOR*3"), e casts a
     number of ballots equal to eir voting limit on that decision.

[Now that all decisions are ordinary by default, this is almost
certainly the desired action.]
