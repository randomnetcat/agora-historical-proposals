Amend Rule 2110 (Win by Paradox) to read:

       If the legality of an action cannot be determined with finality,
       or if by a Judge's best reasoning, not appealed within a week of
       eir Judgement, an action appears equally legal and illegal, then
       the first player to announce this fact wins the game.

Amend Rule 1922 (Defined Regular Patent Titles) by appending this text:

       (d)  Champion, to be awarded to any player who wins the game.   
The
            Herald's report shall record how the player won.
