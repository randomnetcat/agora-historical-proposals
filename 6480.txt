Create a rule titled "Judge's Proposals" with Power = 1.5 and
this text:

      If the submitter of a Proposal makes a claim that the proposal
      is directly relevant to a specified judgement delivered by em
      in the same message, and does not make such a claim about any
      other proposal in connection with the same judgement, then that
      proposal becomes Distributable upon entering the Proposal
      Pool.  Falsely claiming that a proposal is relevant in this
      fashion is the Class 6 Crime of Judicial Distribunannigans.

Amend Rule 2250 (Officer's Proposals) by replacing "Distribunannigans"
with "Official Distribunannigans".
