Create a rule titled "Retroactively colorize second-class VCs" with
Power 2 and this text:

      One second after the creation of this rule, each of these
      players loses all eir Gray VCs, and gains an equal number of
      VCs of the specified colors (in order, repeating until the
      correct total gain is achieved):

        Human Point Two           Green, Blue, Green
        Pineapple Partnership     Blue

      Two seconds after the creation of this rule, this rule is
      repealed.

      This rule takes precedence over all other rules pertaining
      to VCs.
