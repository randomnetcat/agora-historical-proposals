Amend rule 2201 (Self-Ratification) by replacing the paragraph:

       A public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
       ratified when it is continuously undoubted for one week.

with:

       A public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
       ratified when it is continuously undoubted for one week,
       provided:
         - at the time of publication, its publisher was a player; or
         - within one week of publication, it was endorsed by someone
           who was a player at that time; or
         - at the time of publication, it was defined by the rules as
           self-ratifying without need of player endorsement.
