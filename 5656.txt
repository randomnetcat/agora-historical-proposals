Assign a random player, other than Goethe, who is either sitting or
standing to CFJ 2039.
[Currently all the players in the game are barred from judging CFJ 2039;
the exception for Goethe is because e recused emself from it, and thus
presumably does not want to judge it. I think AI-1's enough for this; it
seems wrong for the CotC to be obligated to do something e cannot do,
though, so this proposal is to fix that. Besides, the case probably
should be judged eventualy. (Hmm... I wonder if rule 101 allows us to
imply a mechanism for assigning a judge to the case?)]
