Amend Rule 2021 (Chamber Procedure) by changing it to read:

      (a) The Chamber Fee for a Proposal is a Fee for changing the
          Chamber of a Proposal.  For any given Proposal, the Chamber
          Fee is initially 1.  When a Proposal's Chamber is changed
          via this Rule, the Chamber Fee for the Proposal is doubled.

      (b) An Untainted Speaker, with 2 Supporters, may Sanitise a
          Distributed Proposal that is not already Sane and for which
          the Voting Period has not ended. If the Speaker Sanitises a
          Proposal, the Proposal is Aborted as described elsewhere;
          the Proposal remains Distributable, but becomes Democratic
          and Sane.


Amend Rule 1933 (A Proposal's Chamber) by appending the text:

      Whenever a Proposal's Chamber is changed while the Proposal is
      in its Voting Period, it is Aborted as described elsewhere and
      returned to the Proposal Pool with its Distributability and
      other characteristics intact.
