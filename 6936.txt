      If there are 100 or more rules, and a proposal is adopted
      containing a provision that one or more rules be repealed, and
      if, in the Rulekeepor's estimation, the proposal simplifies the
      ruleset, then the Rulekeepor shall award the Proposer the Boon
      of Tapecutter.

      If the Rulekeepor decides that the proposal does not simplify
