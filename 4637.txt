Create a rule with Power = 3.01 and this text:

     The gamestate hereby becomes what it would be if the
     following vote reports were accurate:

       * Fri, 03 Dec 2004 16:20:53 -0800 : Proposal 4627
       * Sun, 19 Dec 2004 00:48:23 -0800 : Proposals 4628 - 4630
       * Sun, 09 Jan 2005 14:59:32 -0800 : Proposal 4633
       * Sun, 23 Jan 2005 14:39:37 -0800 : Proposal 4635

     One second later, this rule is repealed.

Change the title of Rule 2034 (Votes are Protected) to "Vote
Protection and Cutoff for Challenges", and amend it by appending
this text:

     If the results of an issue are not challenged within seven
     days after the Vote Collector announces them, then the
     announced results are the true results of that issue, even
     if they would otherwise be in error.

Amend Rule 1434 (Default Procedure for Referendum Voting) by
removing this text:

     * Cutoff for Challenges: If the results of a Referendum are not
       challenged within seven days after the Vote Collector
       announces them, then the announced results are the true
       results of that Referendum, even if they would otherwise be in
       error.

Amend Rule 1445 (Defaults for Elections) by removing this text:

     * Cutoff for Challenges: If the results of an Election are not
       challenged within seven days after the Vote Collector
       announces them, then the announced results are the true
       results of that Election, even if they would otherwise be in
       error.
