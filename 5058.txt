Amend rule 2126 by replacing the text

      When an Ordinary Interested proposal is adopted and its proposer
      is not the proposer of any Ordinary proposal previously adopted
      in the same week,

with

      When an Ordinary Interested proposal is adopted and its proposer
      is not the proposer of any Ordinary Interested proposal
      previously adopted in the same week,

[This is an essential fix if both "per-week proposal VCs" and
"Disinterested Proposals" are adopted.  In any other situation it has
no effect.]
