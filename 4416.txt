Amend Rule 1505 (Standard Classes of Crimes and Infractions) to read:

      A Class N Infraction (where N is replaced with a number) is an
      Infraction for which the penalty is N Blots.  Such a penalty is
      assessed upon the execution of a Ticketing Order that Orders
      the Herald to record the penalty.

      A Class N Crime (where N is replaced with a number) is a
      Crime for which the penalty is N Blots and a loss of 2*N Points.
      Such a penalty is assessed upon the execution of a Sentencing
      Order that Orders the Herald to record the penalty, and a Notice
      of Award of the Points penalty.

      If such a Sentencing or Ticketing Order is vacated after the
      Herald has already recorded the penalty, then an equal number
      of Blots are expunged from the penalized entity.  (If the entity
      has less Blots than the amount of the penalty, then all eir Blots
      are expunged.)  In the case of a vacated Sentencing Order, the
      lost Points are to be Awarded back to the penalized entity,
      provided that the game has not been Won between the execution
      of the Sentencing Order and its vacation.
