Amend Rule 1504 by replacing "GUILTY with a valid sentence" with
"GUILTY with one or more valid sentences", by inserting "Only one
sentence is appropriate at a time unless otherwise specified." before
"The valid sentences are:", and by inserting
      * DISMISSAL, with one or more elected offices held by the ninny.
The offices indicated
        are vacated immediately upon the judgement and elections are
initiated for them. This
        continues even if the case is suspended or rendered open
again. If the case is assigned
        a different judgment, then for each office not dismissed by
the new judgment, the ninny
        becomes the holder of that office, any election (including an
Agoran Decision as part of
        an election) for that office is cancelled, and for the
purposes of the rules, e is considered
        to have held the office continuously since the judgement was issued.

Amend Rule 2154 by removing "a)" and "; b) with 4 Supporters, otherwise".
