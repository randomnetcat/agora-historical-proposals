Replace the text of R2221 with the following:

      A Broom is a power 3 entity that can only be created as specified
      by this rule.  A Broom consists of both a rule and a non-empty set
      of spelling and/or grammar corrections to be made to that rule.

Any player CAN create a Broom without objection.  The Broom may then
amend the rule as specified.
