Amend Rule 1504, replacing:
     * SILENCE, a number of Rests, equal to the defined Class of the
       Crime or (if the breach is not a defined crime) the power of
       the breached Rule, are created in the possession of the Ninny.
        If the Ninny showed bad faith by contesting an
       obviously-correct notice or by obstructing the course of
       justice, the judge CAN double the amount of the fine with 2
       Support.
with:
     * SILENCE, a number of Rests, equal to the defined Class of the
       Crime or (if the breach is not a defined crime) the power of
       the breached Rule, rounded to the nearest integer with ties broken
       by rounding up, are created in the possession of the Ninny.
       The judge CAN double the amount of the fine with 2 Support,
       and SHOULD attempt to do so if e believes the Ninny showed
       bad faith by contesting an obviously-correct notice or by
       obstructing the course of justice.
