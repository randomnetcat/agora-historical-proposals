Create a rule titled "Delayed Actions" with Power 3 and this text:

      A delayed action is an action that a person announces (at
      time T) that e will perform at a specific future time
      (time T+N).  The delayed action is validly scheduled if and
      only if all of the following are true:

        a) N is between 0 and 24 hours (inclusive).
        b) T+N is an integral number of seconds past midnight UTC.

      If a delayed action is validly scheduled, then at time T+N, that
      person performs that action as if e announced that e did so,
      unless such an announcement would be otherwise ineffective.

      Multiple delayed actions at the same time T+N are evaluated
      in the order they were announced.

Create a rule titled "The Doctor" with this text:

      The Doctor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      maintaining the timeline of Agora.

      The Doctor's report includes a list of all delayed actions
      announced and/or performed since eir last report (if any,
      or else since the creation of the office).

      If a non-delayed action is performed within one minute of a
      delayed action's time T+N, then the Doctor SHALL within four
      days publish a timing analysis of the non-delayed action.
