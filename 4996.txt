Replace paragraph (d) of Rule 1023 (Common Definitions) with this
text:

     (d) The term "paragraph" shall mean a subset of text determined
         as follows:

         (1) Each bulleted or enumerated (hereafter simply
             "bulleted") section is a unit of text.

         (2) Any remaining text is divided into units at blank lines.

         (3) Each unit of a document has a level as follows.  All
             unbulleted units have level 1.  Each bulleted unit has
             level n+2, where n is the number of bulleted units it is
             nested inside.

         (4) A barrier between two units is a unit appearing between
             those units which has level no greater than that of the
             unit appearing first.

         (5) The units of a document form an ordered tree, with the
             hierarchy determined as follows.  The root is an empty
             unit with level zero, which nominally appears at the
             beginning of the document.  One unit is a descendant of
             another unit if it appears after the latter, has
             strictly greater level, and is not separated from the
             latter by a barrier.  The tree's ordering follows the
             order of the units in the document.

         (6) A "paragraph" identified by partial quotation is
             determined by the minimum sub-tree containing the
             entirety of that quotation.

         (7) A "paragraph" identified by an ordinal n is determined
             by the nth unbulleted unit and its descendants.

         (8) A "paragraph" identified by enumerated section labels is
             determined by the sub-tree arrived at by traversal from
             the root, using the specified series of labels.
