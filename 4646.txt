Append the following to rule 1922

 (e) Tic Tac Toe Champ, To be awarded to any player who, during a
given quarter, has gained 3 boons of '3 in a row'.  If a player holds
this  patent title, immediatly after the turning of a new parchment
they earn the boon  of 'O' and the albatross of 'X'.  Within two weeks
of the turning of a  new parchment, the bearer of this patent title
may proclaim by public  announcement that they either revoke both of
these ephemeral patent  titles, and then claim which other player now
bears them, or they may  keep both the 'X' and the 'O'.   If such a
proclamation is made, it shall take effect as soon as possible. They
must either keep both or  relinquish both.

 Create a rule called 'Tic Tac Toe' with the following text:

 "If during a given week a player earns either exactly  3 boons or 
exactly 3 albatrosses excluding the boon of '3 in a row' a player may
make a public announcement indicating they have gotten 3 in a row
noting which boons/albatrosses they have earned and when.  If this
annoncement is factual, the player earns to boon of '3 in a row'."
