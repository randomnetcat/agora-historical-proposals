Adoption index: 2.0

Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing this text:

    * OVERLOOKED, appropriate if the alleged act allegedly occurred
      at least 200 days before the case was initiated

with this text:

    * OVERLOOKED, appropriate if the initiating announcement alleged
      a rule breach at least 200 days before the case was initiated

[Closes the loophole where the defendant can force OVERLOOKED by
falsely alleging that the breach occurred a long time ago.]

[Identical to Proposal 5787 except for AI and II.  5787 would have
passed 10/1 if it had been democratic.]
