Adoption index: 2

For the purpose of this proposal, time T is the time (if any)
at which Rule 2166 ceased to exist.

If Rule 2166 no longer exists, then create a rule with the same
title, power, and text that Rule 2166 had immediately before time T.

Amend Rule 2166 (or, if it no longer exists, the rule created as
described above) by replacing this text:

      An asset is an entity defined as such by an instrument or
      contract (hereafter its backing document).

with this text:

      An asset is an entity defined as such by an instrument or
      contract (hereafter its backing document), and existing
      solely because its backing document defines its existence.

If Rule 2166 no longer exists, then upon the adoption of this
proposal:

  * All partnerships that existed immediately before time T are
    reinstated into existence with the attributes they possessed
    immediately before time T.

  * All instances of assets that existed immediately before time T
    are reinstated into existence in the possession of their owner
    immediately before time T.

  * If Ivan Hope's VVLOD is greater than 2,400,000, then it is
    decreased by 2,400,000.

  * If Ivan Hope's EVLOD is greater than 2,400,000, then it is
    decreased by 2,400,000.
