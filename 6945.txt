Amend Rule 107 (Initiating Agoran Decisions) by replacing this text:

      The voting period for a decision with at least two options cannot
      be shorter than seven days.

with this text:

      The minimum voting period for a decision with at least two
      options is seven days.

[Parallel with the proposed update of Rule 2313, making it clear that
that clause takes precedence over this one.]
