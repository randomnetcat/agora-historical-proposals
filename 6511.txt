Amend the second paragraph of rule 2233 ("Awarding and Revoking Points")
to read:
{{{
      The contestmaster of a contest CAN and SHALL award and revoke
      points as directed by that contract up so long as the total
      number of points awarded or revoked on any axis in any week
      do not exceed that contest's threshold index. Awards and
      revocations that counteract a previous award or revocation for
      that contest that was not in accordance with it's contract or that
      exceeded the contest's threshold index do not count against this
      weekly limit.
}}}
[[Re-adds a weekly time period to the rule; it was accidentally removed
by proposal 6369.]]
