Amend Rule 1558 (Defaults for Elections for Offices) by appending
this text:

     * If the Vote Collector fails to meet an ASAP requirement to
       publish a list of Candidates, or the identity of the
       winning Candidate, then the Election/Referendum does not
       fail, but becomes Stale.  If a new Election for the same
       Office is initiated, then the stale Election/Referendum fails.

Amend Rule 790 (Filling Vacant Offices) by replacing this text:

     As soon as possible after an Office ceases to have an
     Electee (or is created without installing an Electee),
     the designated conductor of Office Elections shall
     initiate an Election for that Office, as described by
     other Rules.

     As soon as possible after

       a) an Office ceases to have an Electee;
       b) an Office is created without installing an Electee; or
       c) an Election for an Office without an Electee becomes Stale;

     the designated conductor of Office Elections shall
     initiate an Election for that Office, as described by
     other Rules.  This requirement is cancelled if the Office
     comes to have an Electee.
