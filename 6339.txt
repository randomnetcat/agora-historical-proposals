Amend rule 2124 (Agoran Satisfaction) by replacing "The Executor of such
an announcement of intent CANNOT support it" with "The entity intending
to perform an action (generally, but not necessarily, the Executor of
the announcement) CANNOT support the announcement"

[This allows a player acting on behalf of another to intend to do
something to support that intentd; as it stands, they cannot but the
intending player can. This may be desired behavior with regards to how
it acts in partnerships; that's why it's II=1 instead of II=0]
