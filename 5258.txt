Amend Rule 2130 (Activity) by replacing each instance of "may" with
"CAN", and by appending this text:

      A player who has been continuously Inactive for at least three
      months CAN be deregistered by any other player without objection.

[Does not trigger Rule 869's 30-day limit.  Interestingly, neither
does Rule 1789.]

Upon the adoption of this proposal, any player who has been continuously
Inactive for at least three months is deregistered, unless at least one
player objected to eir deregistration during the voting period of this
proposal.

[Get a head start on the new policy.]
