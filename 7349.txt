Adoption index: 1.0

Amend 2387 (Ribbons) by replacing:

      (+R) When an interested proposal is adopted and changes at least
           one rule with Power >= 3, its proposer earns a Red Ribbon.

with:

      (+R) When an interested proposal is adopted and results in a net
           decrease in both the number of rules in the Ruleset and the
           length (in characters) of the Ruleset, its proposer earns a
           Red Ribbon.

[The 'unanimous adoption' is more interesting than an power-3 ribbon
IMO, so chose this one to replace]
