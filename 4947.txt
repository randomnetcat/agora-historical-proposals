Enact a rule titled "Default Timing" with the text:

      Where the rules oblige a person to perform some action but do
      not otherwise specify a time limit by which the action must be
      performed, the action must be performed as soon as possible
      after the first instant when both the person was obliged to
      perform that action and the action was logically possible.
