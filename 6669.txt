In Rule 2224, change the text of the second paragraph from:

       The submitter of a proposal SHOULD set its interest index to 0
       if and only if the proposal's effects are limited to correcting
       errors and/or ambiguities.

to
       The submitter of a proposal SHALL set its interest index to 0 if
       and only if the proposal's effects are limited to correcting
       errors and/or ambiguities.

[As of now, players can easily submit any proposal as II=0 to avoid
paying the fee associated with making it Distributable.]
