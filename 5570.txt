Create a new rule titled "Chambers" with Power=3 and the text:
{{
A player who is a member of an existing public contract CAN make the
contract into a chamber with Agoran consent. A chamber requires no
parties. The authority index of a chamber is an rational number from 0
to 4, and is by default 0. A player CAN set the authority index of any
chamber to any valid value with Agoran consent. The authority index
CANNOT be changed by any other means. A chamber CAN through its own
internal mechanisms increase or decrease the power of any proposal by
an amount less than or equal to its authority index as a result of an
Agoran Decision regarding the acceptance of that proposal in that
chamber.

Any player CAN cause a chamber to cease to be a chamber with Agoran consent.

Repeal R2196 ("Standard Classes of Agoran Decisions")

Amend R106 ("Adopting Proposals") by replacing:
{{
Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
      For this decision, the adoption index is the adoption index of
      the proposal, and the vote collector is the Assessor.

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
      from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
      its adoption index, and then it takes effect.  It does not
      otherwise take effect.
}}
with:
{{
Whenever the power of a proposal ever is equal to or exceeds its
adoption index then the proposal then the Rulekeepor SHALL adopt that
proposal in a timely fashion. When the Rulekeepor adopts a proposal,
unless other rules prevent it from taking effect, its power is set to
the the minimum of four and its adoption index, and it then is removed
from the Proposal Pool and takes effect. A proposal does not otherwise
take effect.
}}

Amend R1607 ("The Promotor") by replacing:
{{
The Promotor MAY distribute a proposal in the Proposal Pool at
      any time.  The Promotor's weekly duties include the distribution
      of each proposal that has been in the Proposal Pool since the
      beginning of that week.

      The Promotor distributes a proposal by publishing it with the
      clear intent of distributing it.  When a proposal is
      distributed, it is removed from the Proposal Pool.  The
      distribution of a proposal initiates the Agoran decision of
      whether to adopt the proposal, as described elsewhere.

      For an Agoran decision of whether to adopt a proposal, the
      following are essential parameters:

      a) Its author (and co-authors, if any).
      b) Its interest index.
}}
with:
{{
The author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN request it be
distributed to a specific chamber by announcement. Any Player CAN,
with 2 support, request a proposal be distributed to a specific
chamber. The Promotor SHALL distribute each such requested proposal to
the specified chamber in a timely fashion unless that proposal has
already been distributed to that chamber previously.

The Promotor CAN remove any proposal from the proposal pool which the
author has not requested to be distributed within the past two weeks
or which has a negitive power. The Promotor SHALL remove any such
propoal from the pool in a timely fashion.

The Promotor distributes a proposal by publishing it with the clear
intent of distributing it. Distributing a proposal initiates an Agoran
decision for the acceptance of the  proposal in the specified chamber.
An agoran decision for the acceptance of a proposal in a specific
chamber may also be known as a chamber decision (generic) or an "XXX
Decision" (where XXX is the name of the chamber). For an agoran
decision regarding the acceptance of a proposal the following are
essential parameters:

a) Its author (and co-authors, if any).
b) Its interest index.
c) The specified chamber.

The eligible voters on a chamber decision are the list of eligible
voters defined in that chamber, or in the case there is no such list
all parties to that chamber. The voting limit of each eligible voter
on chamber decision is equal to the voting limit(s) defined by that
chamber, or in the case there is none defined the voting limit is 1.

Repeal R2142 ("Support Democracy")

Amend R2019 ("Prerogitives") by replacing:
{{
      c) Wielder of Veto.  The Wielder of Veto CAN veto an ordinary
         decision in its voting period by announcement; this increases
         its Adoption Index by 1.

      d) Wielder of Rubberstamp.  The Wielder of Rubberstamp CAN
         rubberstamp an ordinary decision in its voting period by
         announcement; this decreases its quorum to 3, rules to the
         contrary notwithstanding.
}}
with:
{{
c) Wielder of Veto. The Wielder of Veto CAN veto any proposal in the
proposal pool by announcement; this increases its Adoption Index by 1.

d) Wielder of Rubberstamp. The Wielder of Rubberstamp CAN (once per
proposal) rubberstamp any proposal in the proposal pool by
announcement; this increases its Power by 0.5.

Amend R2177 ("The Senate") by replacing:
{{
During emergency session, any Senator CAN declare a filibuster
      on a proposal in its voting period, with 2 supporting Senators,
      provided no filibuster has been declared on that proposal in the
      past.  Any Senator CAN end a filibuster on a proposal with 4
      supporting Senators.

      A proposal that ends its voting period in filibuster has a
      quorum of the number of eligible voters plus 1, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.
}}
with:
{{
During emergency session, any Senator CAN declare a filibuster on a
proposal in the proposal pool, with 2 supporting Senators, provided no
filibuster has been declared on that proposal in the past. Any Senator
