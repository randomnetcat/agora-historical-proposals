Create a rule titled "Contests" with this text:

      A contest is a contract that identifies itself as such, and
      identifies exactly one party as its contestmaster; all other
      parties are its contestants.

      Points are a measure of a player's contentiousness.  The
      number of points possessed by a player is eir score.  When a
      player registers, eir score is set to zero.

      A contestmaster may award a total of up to 10 points per month
      to one or more contestants, unless e was contestmaster of a
      different contest for at least 15 days of the previous month.

      A player with 100 or more points may win the game by announcing
      this fact.  Upon such an announcement, each player's score is
      set to zero.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, each player's score is set to zero.
