(We don't need to prevent the ADoP from being a cardinal.  If e
attempts to install emself as Speaker while e is not actually a
pope, then the installation is platonically unsuccessful.)

Amend Rule 402 (Church and State) by replacing this text:

       A cardinal is an active, ready player who is neither the current
       Speaker nor the Associate Director of Personnel.

with this text:

       A cardinal is an active, ready player who is not the Speaker.
