In rule 2152, add the following bullet to the list:
      6. NEED NOT:  Failing to perform the described action does not
         violate the rule in question.
Renumber the other entries in the list accordingly, retaining their
relative order, so that the list begins at 1 remains consecutive. [N.B.
there is only one such renumbering]
