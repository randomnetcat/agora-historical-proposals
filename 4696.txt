Repeal Rules 1678 and 2061

Create a new rule entitled "The Assessor's Boon Duties" with the following text:

        * If a Proposal passes, and that Proposal was submitted by a
          Player within that Player's Grace Period, then the Assessor
          shall award the Proposor the Boon of Prodigy.

        * If an Interested Democratic Proposal passes, and no Votes
          were cast AGAINST it, then the Assessor shall award the
          Proposor the Boon of Zeitgeist.

        * If a proposal submitted on Guy Fawkes Day is adopted then the 
          Assessor shall award the proposer the boon of a penny.

Remove the following from R2060

      If a Proposal so submitted is subsequently adopted, the Assessor
      shall award the Proposer the Boon of A Penny.

Create a new rule entitled " Ephemeral Time Limits" with the following text:

      If an Ephemeral Patent Title is earned between one week before
      the designated end of the last Quarter and one week before the
      end of the current Quarter then it must be awarded before the
      turning of a new parchment.  For every one of these Ephemeral
      Patent Titles that has not been awarded by the end of the turning 
      whomever is responsible for awarding the Ephemeral Patent 
      Title commits the Class .1 Infraction of Ephemeral Nondisclosure
      which in the case of Boons is reportable by whomever did not
      receive eir Boon, or for Albatrosses any player.

      The announcement that a proposal does not earn the proposer the
      Boon of Tapecutter must also follow these time restrictions.
