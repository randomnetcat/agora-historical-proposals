Amend Rule 2181 (The Accountor) by replacing this text:

      The Accountor is the default recordkeepor for all assets that do
      not specify a different recordkeepor.  While there are no such
      assets, the Accountor has no report.

with this text:

      The Accountor's report includes a list of classes of assets and
      their backing documents and recordkeepors.

      The Accountor is the default recordkeepor for all assets whose
      backing document does not specify a different recordkeepor.
