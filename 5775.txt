Amend Rule 1728 (Dependent Actions) to read:

     A person (the performer) CAN perform an action dependently (a
     dependent action) by announcement if and only if all of the
     following are true:

       a) The rules explicitly authorize the performer to perform
          the action by at least one of the following methods
          (N is 1 if not otherwise specified):

            1) Without N Objections, where N is a positive integer.
            2) With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer.
            3) With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple
               of 0.1 with a minimum of 1.

       b) A person (the initiator) announced intent to perform the
          action, unambiguously specifying the action and method
          (including the value of N), at most fourteen days earlier,
          and (if the action depends on objections) at least four days
          earlier.

       c) At least one of the following is true:

            1) The performer is the initiator.

            2) The initiator was authorized to perform the action
               due to holding a rule-defined position now held by the
               performer.

            3) The initiator is authorized to perform the action,
               the action depends on support, the performer has
               supported the intent, and the rule authorizing the
               performance does not explicitly prohibit supporters
               from performing it.

       d) Agora is Satisfied with the announced intent, as defined by
          other rules.

     A dependent action CAN be performed non-dependently as otherwise
     permitted by the rules.
