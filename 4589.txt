Amend Rule 1958 (Nominating with Budgets) by replacing this text:

        (d) When the voting period begins, the vote collector shall
            announce each candidate's last valid proto-budget.

        (e) When the voting period ends, the winner's last valid
            proto-budget becomes the budget of that office, and e shall
            announce it as soon as possible. If the election ends
            without a winner, then the existing Budget remains in
            effect.

with this text:

        (d) As soon as possible after the end of the nominating period,
            the vote collector shall announce each candidate's last
            valid proto-budget.

        (e) When the election ends, the winner's last valid proto-budget
            becomes the budget of that office, and the winner shall
            announce it as soon as possible.  If the election ends
            without a winner, then the existing budget remains in effect.

Upon the adoption of this Proposal, the gamestate becomes what it would
be if, whenever an Election for Office ended with a winner and a valid
proto-budget, but without a Voting Period, the proto-budget became the
budget for that Office.
