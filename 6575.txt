[Historically, the Herald has done this when traffic has been low enough
to combine the offices.  Now that the insulator and Herald are no longer
dealers, this is appropriate workload].

Amend R2228 by replacing:
     The Insulator is an office, and the recordkeepor of Rests.
with:
     The Herald is the recordkeepor of Rests.

Amend Rule 2229 by replacing "Insulator's" with "Herald's".

Amend Rule 2230 by replacing all instances of "Insulator" with "Herald".
