Amend Rule 879 (Quorum) to read:

      Quorum for an Agoran decision is as follows, where N is the
      number of eligible voters with a positive voting limit on that
      decision:

      - if the decision is Plutocratic, N/2 rounded up;

      - otherwise, N/3 rounded up, with a minimum of five (unless this
        is greater than N, in which case quorum is N).

[What Murphy used to defeat my repeal-Props proposal - but it's too
powerful.  Except on rather popular proposals, it's effectively a
one-person veto, since if the proposal gets less than five valid
votes, a single no-vote is enough to kill it (though if it does get
five, it's good for quorum all the way to 10 no-votes, which is a bit
weird).]

Proposal: Two-way Plutocracy (AI=2)

Amend Rule 2375 (Plutocratic Chamber) by replacing:

      Any entity may spend a Ruble to increase an entity's voting
      limit on a Plutocratic Decision by 1.

with:

      Any entity may spend a ruble to increase an entity's voting
      limit on a Plutocratic Decision by one.  Any entity may spend
      two rubles to decrease an entity's voting limit on a Plutocratic
      Decision by one (to a minimum of zero).
