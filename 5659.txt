Amend Rule 2208 (Clarity of Announcements) to read:

      An ambiguous attempt to perform an action by announcement is
      disambiguated according to the good-faith discretion of the
      person primarily responsible for recording the results of
      that action (or, if there is no such person, the Speaker).
