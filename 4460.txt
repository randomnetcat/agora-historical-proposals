Amend Rule 594 by replacing the text reading:

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

with text reading:

      The Proposer of a Proposal may request an Adoption Index for the
      Proposal in the same message in which e submits it. If the requested
      Adoption Index is not reasonably clear, e shall be not be considered
      to have requested an Adoption Index for that Proposal. The Adoption
      Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value requested by its
      Proposer (if any), and the value required for that Proposal by the
      Rules (if any).
