Create the following rule:
        There is a person switch, known as Hat-Wearing; its valid values are Wearing
        and Not Wearing (default). It is tracked by the Department of Mental Health.
        A person may toggle their Hat-Wearing by announcement; this is "putting on"
        or "taking off" a hat.

Upon adoption of this proposal, Murphy puts on a hat.
