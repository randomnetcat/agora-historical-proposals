Amend Rule 2169 (Equity Cases) by replacing the paragraph beginning "The
members of the bases of the parties to the contract" with this text:

     The initiator is unqualified to be assigned as judge of the
     case.  All other members of the bases of the parties to the
     contract are also unqualified, except while this would result
     in all entities being unqualified.
