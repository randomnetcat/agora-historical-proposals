Amend Rule 2141 (Role and Attributes of Rules) by replacing this text:

     For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
     the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
     substantive aspects of the rule.

with this text:

     Every rule is assigned to a number of committees (possibly zero).

     For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
     the text, power, ID number, title, and committee assignments (if
     any) of a rule are all substantive aspects of the rule.

Amend Rule 1681 (The Logical Rulesets) by replacing this text:

     The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
     number, revision number, power, title, and text.

with this text:

     The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
     number, revision number, power, committee assignments (if any),
     title, and text.

Create a rule titled "Committee Rejection" with Power 3 and this text:

     If a proposal would amend (whether directly or indirectly) a
     rule assigned to a committee, and at least half the members
     of that committee (measured at the start of its voting period)
     who voted on that proposal cast more votes AGAINST it than FOR
     it, then it is entirely without effect, even if adopted.

Create a rule titled "Committee Membership" with Power 2 and this text:

     The following committees exist, with the following charter
     positions:

       a) Committee on Rules (Rulekeepor, Promotor, Assessor, Grand
            Poobah, Speaker, Anarchist)

       b) Committee on Administration (all high-priority officers)

       c) Committee on the Judiciary (Clerk of the Courts, all
            first-class players whose judicial rank is Supreme and
            whose posture is standing or sitting)

       d) Committee on Crime (Justiciar, all first-class players whose
            hawkishness is hanging and whose posture is standing or
            sitting)

       d) Committee on Finance (Accountor, all recordkeepors of
            rule-backed assets)

       e) Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship (Notary,
            all partnerships, Liaison of each subsidized contract)

       f) Committee on Indian Affairs (Scorekeepor, all contestmasters)

       g) Committee on Foreign Relations (Speaker, Ambassador, all
            Embassies)

     While an active player holds one or more charter positions for
     a committee, e is a charter member of that committee.  When a
     charter member of a committee ceases to hold any charter
     positions for that committee, or ceases to be an active player,
     e ceases to be a member of that committee.

     While a committee's number of charter members (CM) is less than
     five, a non-member CAN spend any 5-CM of eir Notes forming
     consecutive tones of a pentatonic scale to become a non-charter
     member of that committee.  While a committee's number of members
     is more than five, its non-charter member that has been one for
     the longest continuous period of time ceases to be a member.

     The IADoP's report includes the membership of each committee.

[As of this writing, I believe charter membership would be as follows:
 Rules (comex, PNP, AFO, OscarMeyr, ais523, Wooble)
 Admin (AFO, Wooble, Murphy, OscarMeyr, w1n5t0n, PNP, comex, Taral)
 Judiciary (Murphy, ais523, comex, Goethe, Taral)
 Crime (OscarMeyr, Taral)
 Finance (Wooble, Taral)
 SB+E (w1n5t0n, AFO, Bayes, HP2, TNP2, PBA, PNP, Racket, RBoA, Wooble,
   ehird)
 Indian Affairs (Taral, Goethe, ais523, root, Wooble, Murphy)
 Foreign Relations (ais523, PNP)
