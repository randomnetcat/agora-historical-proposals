[This is the part of Proposal 6025 that failed, now fixed to account
for Proposal 5989.  The change of switch tracker is deliberate; the
Scorekeepor needs to know it in order to know which point awards are
valid, while the Notary has no comparable need.]

Amend Rule 2136 (Contests) by replacing this text:

     Contestmaster is a public contract switch, tracked by the
     Notary, with a default value of 'none', and a set of possible
     values which consists of all first-class players and 'none'.

     A public contract is a contest if and only if it has a
     contestmaster other than 'none'.

with this text:

     Contestmaster is a public contract switch, tracked by the
     Scorekeepor, with values 'none' (default) and all first-class
     players.  A contest is a public contract whose contestmaster
     is not 'none'.
