Amend rule 2126 by replacing item "b)" of the list of ways that VCs
may be gained with

      b) At the end of each month, for each office with a report, the
         player (if any) who held that office for the majority of that
         month gains two Green VCs (if the office has a weekly report)
         or one Green VC (if it has only a monthly report), unless
         another person deputised for that office while that player
         held that office during that month.

and replacing item "b)" of the list of ways that VCs may be lost with

      b) At the end of each month, for each office, for each player
         who has held that office during that month, if another person
         deputised for that office while that player held that office
         during that month then that player loses one Green VC.

[No need for retroactivity, and everything is handled in one go at the
end of the month.  Deputisation provides a well-defined way to
determine whether an officer is failing in eir duties in a way that
the players care about.]
