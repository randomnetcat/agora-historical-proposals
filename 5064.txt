Adoption index: 1

Amend rule 2136 by replacing the text from "is eir score" up to but
not including the next "." with "is eir score, which is always a
rational number, and scores are not categorically prevented from being
any particular rational number".

[If this is adopted, it overrides "real scores" and "algebraic
scores".  It will be overridden if "integer scores" is adopted.]
