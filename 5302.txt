Amend rule 2136 by replacing the text

      A contestmaster may award a total of up to 10 points per week to
      one or more contestants as permitted by the contest, unless e is
      contestmaster of a different contest simultaneously or has been
      at any time during the preceding span of seven days.

with

      For each contest which has been a contest for at least a week,
      and has as its contestmaster a first-class person who has been
      contestmaster of that contest for the entire past week and has
      not been the contestmaster of any other contest during the past
      week, the contestmaster CAN award a total of up to 10 points per
      week to one or more contestants as permitted by the contest.

[Contestmaster must be first-class, to avoid minting contestmasters.
Minimum wait of a week after a contest is formed before it can award
points, to give a real chance for contestants to join and become
subject to the fairness requirement.  Minimum wait of a week after a
change of contestmaster (which does not need to disrupt the weekly
cycle of point awards) to avoid a hole involving rapid changes of
contestmaster.  All reformulated as per-contest rather than
per-contestmaster, to better capture the intent.]
