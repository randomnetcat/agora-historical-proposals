Title: Reinstate Excess CFJs

Enact a rule titled "Excess CFJs", reading:

      A judicial case initiated by a person who has previously
      initiated five or more cases during the same Agoran Week as that
      case is an Excess CFJ.  The Clerk of the Courts CAN, by
      announcement, refuse an Excess CFJ that has not had any judge
      assigned to it.  Refusal of an Excess CFJ causes it to cease to
      be a judicial case.

[I tried to merge this into an existing rule, but I couldn't find any
 place that is approprate in both subject and power.]
