Amend Rule 107 (Initiating Agoran Decisions) by appending this text:

      Defining a decision as secret is secured with a power
      threshold of 2.  Votes on a secret decision are sent
      and retracted by sending a message to its vote collector
      instead of sending a public message, and these actions SHALL
      NOT be disclosed to anyone else during its voting period.

Create a rule titled "Secret Proposals" with Power 2 and this text:

      If the author of a proposal identifies it as secret when e
      submits it, and e has not already done so for another proposal
      submitted in the same week, then the decision on whether to adopt
      that proposal is secret.

Create a rule titled "Secret Elections" with Power 2 and this text:

      If the IADoP identifies an election decision as secret when e
      initiates it, and e has not already done so for another election
      decision initiated in the same month, then that decision is
      secret.
