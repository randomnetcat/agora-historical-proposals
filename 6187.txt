Title: Instant Adoption
Author: coppro
Co-authors: Goethe
Adoption index: 3.0

Create a new power-3 rule:
{{
      A player may cause instant adoption of a proposal that has not
      yet been voted on with A*P/(A+1) support, rounded down to the
      nearest integer, where A is the proposal's adoption index and P
      is, if there is an ongoing vote on the proposal, the number of
      eligible first-class voters, otherwise the number of active
      first-class players.

      When a proposal is instantly adopted, it is removed from the
      Proposal Pool, any Agoran Decisions on whether to adopt it
      cease to exist, its power is set to the lesser of its Adoption
      Index and 4, and it takes effect, any rule to the contrary
      notwithstanding. The Assessor SHALL make note of the effects of
      the instant adoption, but failure to do so does not prevent the
      instant adoption from taking effect.
}}

Amend rule 106 by replacing {This rule takes precedence over any rule
which would permit a proposal to take effect.} with {Causing or
otherwise permitting a proposal to take effect is only possible by Rules
with power greater than or equal to 3.}.
