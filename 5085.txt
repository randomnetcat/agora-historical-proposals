Amend rule 1367 to read

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees.  The degrees are

      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Bachelor of Nomic                  (B.N.)
      - Master of Nomic                    (M.N.)
      - Doctor of Nomic History            (D.N.Hist.)
      - Doctor of Nomic Science            (D.N.Sci.)
      - Doctor of Nomic Philosophy         (D.N.Phil.)

      Degrees are ranked in the order they appear in this rule, with
      degrees listed later being ranked higher.

      A degree CANNOT be awarded to any person more than once, and
      CANNOT be revoked once awarded.  A degree CAN be awarded by the
      action of an instrumennt with power greater than or equal to the
      power of this rule, but CANNOT be awarded in any other way.

      A degree SHOULD be awarded ONLY IF its new bearer has published
      a suitable thesis with explicit intent to qualify for a degree
      (though not necessarily for the specific degree being awarded).
      A thesis is an essay whose topic is any facet of Agora Nomic or
      of nomic in general.  A thesis's suitability depends on its
      originality and quality, with regard to the rank of the degree
      to be awarded.

Change the power of rule 1367 to 1.5.

Repeal rule 1370.

[We don't award degrees often enough to justify the rather complex
process of rule 1370.  We can simplify it to a proposal process (which
of course was always an option anyway), with advisory rule text on
what should qualify.  Upmutate so that awarding a degree is more
difficult than a normal proposal passage: in fact, this makes it more
difficult than it previously was.]
