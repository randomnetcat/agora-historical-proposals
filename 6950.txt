If Rule 2255 (The Court) no longer defines the position of Grand Vizier,
then amend it to have the same text that it did immediately before it
ceased to do so.

Amend Rule 2255 (The Court) by appending this text to the section
defining the position of Grand Vizier:

      For the purpose of this action, the Grand Vizier is considered to
      be the holder of that office.
