Amend Rule 2233 (Awarding and Revoking Points) to read:

      For each of a contest's axes, where N is the number of its
      parties that were active first-class players at the beginning of
      the week, the contestmaster of that contest:

        a) CAN award <axis> points to its other parties by announcement
           specifying that contest, unless the total points awarded in
           this way for that contest and week would thereby exceed 5N.

        b) CAN revoke <axis> points from its other parties by
           announcement specifying that contest, unless the total points
           revoked in this way for that contest and week would thereby
           exceed 2N.

        c) SHALL award and revoke <axis> points as explicitly described
           in its contract (subject to the above limits), or as needed
           to counteract an award/revocation specifying that contest but
           not explicitly described in either its contract or this
           clause (in which case neither the corrected award/revocation
           nor the correction count against the contest's weekly limit).
