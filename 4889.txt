Amend Rule 1006 (Offices) by replacing this text:

       The Herald shall list the holder of each office,

with this text:

       The Herald's Report shall list the holder of each office,

and by replacing this text:

       than the officer shall publish that information once a month

with this text:

       then the officer shall publish that information at least once a
       month

Amend Rule 1795 (Order Timing) to read:

       Orders to perform an action shall be satisfied as soon as
       possible, unless the Order specifies a different time limit.  The
       minimum time limit is 72 hours after the Order takes effect; any
       time limit that would be shorter is extended to the minimum.

       If an Order to perform an action is directed to an Office or  
other
       position of authority, and the holder of that position changes
       after the Order takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied,
       then the time limit is extended (if needed) to one week after the
       change.
