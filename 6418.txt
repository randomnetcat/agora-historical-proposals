Amend Rule 1688 (Power) by replacing "A rule that secures a change" with
"A rule that secures a change, action, or value", by replacing "to
perform that change" with "to perform that change or action, or to
modify that value", and by replacing "the change's power threshold" with
"the change, action, or value's power threshold."

[Security has become more general than just changes.]
