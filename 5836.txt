Amend Rule 1586 (Definition and Continuity of Entities) to read:

     If multiple rules or contracts (hereafter documents) attempt to
     define an entity with the same name, then they refer to the same
     entity.  A document-defined entity's name CANNOT be changed to be
     the same as another document-defined entity.

     A document referring to an entity by name refers to the entity
     that had that name when the document first came to include that
     reference, even if the entity's name has since changed.

     If the documents defining an entity are repealed or amended such
     that they no longer define that entity, then that entity and its
     properties cease to exist.

     If the documents defining an entity are amended such that they
     still define that entity but with different properties, then that
     entity and its properties continue to exist to whatever extent
     is possible under the new definitions.
