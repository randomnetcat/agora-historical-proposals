Change the title of Rule 2171 to "Social Contract", change its Power
to 1.7, and amend it to read:

      Every player, as a part of becoming a player, implicitly enters
      into a binding agreement (hereafter the Social Contract) to be
      bound by the rules.  If an equity case identifies this contract,
      entities other than the initiator do not thereby become
      unqualified to judge it, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The proposal, fora, and registration processes shall, prima
      facie, be considered to be protective of a Player's rights and
      privileges with respect to making and changing the agreement to
      be bound by the rules.
