[It's absurd that people who have punted on multiple CFJs,
making more work for officers, have more VCs than said officers.]

Amend Rule 2126 by replacing this text:
      A player who submits a judgement during eir Deliberation Period
      gains one VC.  A player whose judgement is overturned loses one
      VC, if e has any.
with this text:
      A player who submits a judgement during eir Deliberation Period
      gains one VC.  A player whose judgement is overturned, or who
      is recused for failing to judge within eir Deliberation Period,
      loses one VC, if e has any.

and by replacing this text:
      At the end of each quarter, for each office, the player (if
      any) who held that office for the majority of that quarter
      gains one VC.
with this text:
      At the end of each month, for each office, the player (if
      any) who held that office for the majority of that month
      gains two VCs, unless the Speaker publicly announces that
      the officer has performed poorly in eir duties.
