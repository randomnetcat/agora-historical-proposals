Amend Rule 2365 (Pool Fees) to read:

     Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, if at least five
     non-subsidized proposals have been created earlier in the week,
     then creating a non-subsidized proposal has a cost of 1 ruble.

     A proposal is subsidized if and only if, when submitted, it is
     clearly labeled as a re-submission of another proposal with
     identical or substantially similar text on which a decision
     failed quorum within the past month.
