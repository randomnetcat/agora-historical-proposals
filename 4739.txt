Amend Rule 2069 by replacing the text reading:

           If, at any time, the number of pending draws for all
           gamblers is greater than the number of cards in the Deck,
           then the Deckmastor shall transfer all of the cards in the
           Discard Pile to the Deck before dealing any cards.  This
           transfer is known as a Reshuffle and is performed as a
           single action.

with:

           Whenever a player makes a true announcement that the number
           of pending draws for all gamblers is greater than the
           number of cards in the Deck, or that there are no cards in
           the Deck, then the Deckmastor shall transfer all of the
           cards in the Discard Pile to the Deck before dealing any
           cards.  This transfer is known as a Reshuffle and is
           performed as a single action.
