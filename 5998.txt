Amend Rule 2154 to read
{

     Any player CAN by announcement initiate an election for an
     elected office for which no election is already in progress,
     nominating at least one active player.

     During the first four days of the election (the nomination
     period), any player CAN by announcement nominate one or more
     active players.

     As soon as possible after the nomination period ends, the IADoP
     SHALL initiate an Agoran decision to determine the new
     officeholder. For this decision:

      1) The valid options (hereafter the candidates) are the active
         players who, during the election,

           a) received and accepted a nomination for the office
              before the decision was initiated (self-nomination
              constitutes acceptance), and

           b) did not decline a nomination for the office, and

           c) are Senators if there is currently an Emergency Session.

         The set of candidates can change after the decision is
         initiated.

      2) If there is no Emergency Session at the time the decision is
initiated, the eligible voters are the active players. Otherwise, the
eligible voters are the active Senators.

      3) Each eligible voter's voting limit is one. An ordered list
         of multiple choices constitutes a conditional vote for the
         first choice if it could be the outcome, otherwise the
         second choice if it could be the outcome, and so forth.

     Upon the resolution of this decision, its outcome (if a
     candidate) is installed into the office, and the election ends.
