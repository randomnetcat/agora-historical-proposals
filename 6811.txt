Amend Rule 911 (Appeal Cases) by appending, immediately after this
text:

      As soon as possible after a judicial panel is assigned, each
      member of the panel SHALL publish an appeals opinion indicating
      a valid judgement to assign to the case -- only the last such
      published opinion for each member is used to determine the
      outcome.  Each member SHOULD choose an appropriate judgement,
      and include arguments for eir choice.

this text, followed by a paragraph break:

      If prejudice is not explicitly specified, then an opinion
      indicating AFFIRM or REMAND implicitly indicates without
      prejudice, while an opinion indicating REMIT or OVERRULE
      implicitly indicates with prejudice.
