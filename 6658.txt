       in eir possession to satisfy the Winning Condition of

with this text:

       If this rule mentions at least six different specific colors for
       Ribbons, then upon a win announcement that one or more players
       each possess at least one Ribbon of each such color, all those
       players satisfy the Winning Condition of Renaissance.

       Cleanup procedure:  For each of those players, one Ribbon of each
       such color in eir possession is destroyed.
