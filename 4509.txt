[Improved parallelism with Rules 1434 (Default Procedure for Referendum
  Voting) and 1445 (Defaults for Elections).  Change "shall be" to "is",
  and add "at the time the Election begins".]

Amend Rule 1558 (Defaults for Elections for Offices) by replacing this text:

       * The Vote Collector of the Election shall be the Assistant
         Director of Personnel, unless the Office which the Election is
         seeking to fill is that of the Assistant Director of
         Personnel, in which case the Vote Collector shall be the
         Speaker; and

with this text:

       * The Vote Collector is the Assistant Director of Personnel at
         the time the Election begins, unless the Election seeks to
         fill the Office of Assistant Director of Personnel, in which
         case the Vote Collector is the Speaker at the time the Election
         begins.
