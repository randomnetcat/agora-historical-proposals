Amend Rule 2019 (Prerogatives) by appending this text:

         e) Wielder of Extra Votes.  The Wielder of Extra Votes at
            the start of an ordinary proposal's voting period has a
            voting limit on that proposal of 1.4 times what it would
            be otherwise (rounded using the same method as the weekly
            update of EVLOD), rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
