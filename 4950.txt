Adoption index: 3


Amend rule 2126 by replacing the text "eir VCs are set to zero" with
"eir VCs are set to zero and eir voting limit on ordinary proposals is
set to one".

[VLOP isn't explicitly set for new players anywhere.  Without this
amendment, a former player rejoining probably has eir old VLOP,  
unaffected
by intervening win-induced resets of players' VLOPs.]
