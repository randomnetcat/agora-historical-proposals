Delete the following text from Rule 2255 (The Court):

      Third Position: Grand Vizier
      Influence Level: 5
      Position: The Grand Vizier CAN perform any action that an
      officer both CAN and MAY (or SHALL) perform by virtue of holding
      that office as follows:
      (a)  If the rules specify that the officer CAN perform the
           action in question by announcement, then the Grand Vizier
           CAN perform that action With Notice, indicating also that e
           is acting as Vizier;
      (b)  If the rules specify a dependent action method for the
           officer performing the action, then the Grand Vizier CAN
           perform the action using the same dependent action method
           with notice, indicating also that e is acting as Vizier.

And, in that same rule, simultaneously do each of the followin:

Replace all instances of the word "Fourth" with "Third".
Replace all instances of the word "Fifth" with "Fourth".
Replace all instances of the word "Sixth" with "Fifth".

[Removes the broken Grand Vizier position and renumbers the other
positions accordingly. We don't really need that position, as there
are still 5 other unique positions on the list plus speaker, which is
still about half of our active player basis]
