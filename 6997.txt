[Just to confuse things.  The goal is that Sole holdings vary wildly,
because players get a lot of them, but arbitrarily large numbers are
spent on single decisions.  Oh, and it becomes an incentive for
inactive players to become active again...]

If no Rule exists named "Souls", then this proposal has no effect.

Create a Power-2 Rule titled "Soles":

      Soles are a class of assets tracked by the Assessor, restricted
      to players.  At the start of each day, each player gains one
      Sole.

      Pinnedness is a Sole switch tracked by the Assessor, whose value
      is either "unpinned" (default) or a single Ordinary decision
      (that the Sole is pinned to).  Soles with the samed Pinnedness
      are fungible.  The owner of an unpinned Sole can pin it to a
      specified Ordinary decision by announcement.

      The Shoemaker for a decision is the single person (if any) with
      the most Soles pinned to that decision.  The Shoemaker's voting
      limit on that decision is three higher than it would otherwise
      be.

      When a decision is resolved, all Soles pinned to it are
      destroyed.
