Repeal Rule 2347 (Speed).

Amend Rule 1023 (Common Definitions) by replacing this text:

     (a) The phrases "in a timely fashion" and "as soon as possible"
         mean "within X days", where X is 14 when the Speed is Slow,
         7 when it is Normal and 5 when it is Fast. This time period
         is set when the requirement is created (ie. X days before
         the limit ends).

         most fourteen days earlier, and (if the action depends on
         objections or notice) at least X days earlier, where X is a
         number which depends on the Speed at the time of intention
         as follows: Slow: 5, Normal: 4, Fast: 2.
