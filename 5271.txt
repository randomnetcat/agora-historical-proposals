         that switch whose value is not Null.

with this text:

      c) Exactly one officer who tracks instances of that switch.
         That officer's report includes the value of each instance of
         that switch whose value is not its default value.

Amend Rule 869 (How to Join and Leave Agora) by replacing each instance
of "Null" with "Unregistered".

Amend Rule 2130 (Activity) by replacing "each player's activity" with
"each non-Active player's activity".

[Knowing how long a player has been continuously inactive is needed to
determine whether e can be deregistered for inactivity.  Knowing how
long a player has been continuously inactive is less important.]
