Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by appending this text to the
section on GUILTY:

       This judgement is also appropriate if the Accused has
       publically stated eir guilt in the case.  However,
       initiating a criminal case with oneself as the Accused
       does not constitute such a statement.
