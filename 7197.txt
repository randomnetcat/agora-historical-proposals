[Changes the SHOULD NOT judge inappropriately to SHALL NOT. Because of
the prohibition on judging guilty when a player reasonably believes
eir action to be legal, no judge can be punished unless e accidentally
judges a case inappropriately. As it stands, because of the SHOULD
NOT, no judge can be punished criminally even if e deliberately
publishes an incorrect opinion.]

In rule 2158, change the text reading:

A judge SHOULD NOT assign an inappropriate judgement to any judicial case.

to read:

A judge SHALL NOT assign an inappropriate judgement to any judicial case.
