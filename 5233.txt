Amend Rule 2125 (Regulation Regulations) to read:

      An action is regulated if and only if any of the following is true:

        (a) The rules specify that the action CANNOT be performed, or
            place conditions on whether it CAN or CANNOT be performed.

        (a) The rules specify that the action MAY NOT be performed, or
            place conditions on whether it MAY or MAY NOT be performed.

        (c) The action would, as part of its effect, modify information
            that some player is REQUIRED to record.  Any such action
            CANNOT be performed except as allowed by the rules.

        (d) The action would, as part of its effect, make it IMPOSSIBLE
            to make arbitrary modifications to the rules by any
            combinations of actions by players, and/or IMPOSSIBLE to
            adopt proposals within a four-week period.  Any such action
            CANNOT be performed.

        (e) The courts have held that the action is regulated, and this
            finding has not been overturned.

[Specify which things are IMPOSSIBLE and which are ILLEGAL.]

Repeal Rule 1698 (The Proposal System Is Protected).

[Merged into Rule 2125.]
