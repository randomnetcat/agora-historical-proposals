Take it to Equity!

[Equity first, then criminal].

Amend Rule 1742 by appending the following paragraph:

     As it is manifestly unjust to bring criminal punishment
     into a manner of equity, if a player is found GUILTY of
     violating this Rule by failing to act in accordance with
     a contract, the only appropriate sentence is DISCHARGE,
     unless said failure is with respect to a previously-
     imposed Equity judgement.

[GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt could still be a finding of
fact, perhaps to be used in a later equity case, but you can't be
punished for it via this mechanism, at least until the equity
courts have had their say].
