Amend Rule 2178 (Public Contracts) by replacing "Any other contract is
private." with "All other contracts are private."

Amend Rule 2145 (Partnerships) by replacing this text:

     A binding agreement governed by the rules which devolves its
     legal obligations onto a subset of its parties, numbering at
     least two, collectively, is a partnership.

with this text:

     A partnership is a contract that devolves each of its legal
     obligations onto at least one of its parties, but does not
     devolve all of them solely onto one of its parties.

Amend Rule 2136 (Contests) by replacing this text:

     Contestmaster is a public contract switch, tracked by the
     Notary, with a default value of 'none', and a set of possible
     values which consists of all first-class players and 'none'.

     A public contract is a contest if and only if it has a
     contestmaster other than 'none'. The Scorekeepor's report
     contains the contestmaster of each contest.

with this text:

     Contestmaster is a public contract switch, tracked by the
     Scorekeepor, with values 'none' (default) and all first-class
     players.  A contest is a public contract whose contestmaster
     is not 'none'.
