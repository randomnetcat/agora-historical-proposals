Set the power of the rule entitled The Dictionary to 1.0.

Amend R105 by replacing:

        (a) enact a rule.  The new rule has power equal to the minimum
            of the power specified by the enacting instrument,
            defaulting to one if the enacting instrument does not
            specify, and the maximum power permitted by other rules.

with:

        (a) enact a rule.  The new rule has power equal to the power
            specified by the enacting instrument; however, if the
            instrument does not so specify, or specifies a power not
            otherwise permitted by the rules, then the new rule's
            power is one.
