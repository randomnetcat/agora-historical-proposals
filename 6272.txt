For each contest that became a contest after the beginning of the Agoran
week during which this proposal was proposed, flip that contest's
contestmaster to null.

For each point awarded through a contest that became a contest after
this proposal was proposed, revoke that point.

[Note: this intentionally doesn't attempt to revert points from
existing scam contests; it's only fair to let em keep them.]
