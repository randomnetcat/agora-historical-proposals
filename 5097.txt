Amend rule 2126 by appending to the list of ways that VCs may be spent

      e) A player may spend two VCs of the same color to make another
         player gain one VC of that color.

[If someone only earns VCs in one way, and so of only one color, e can
acquire VCs of a second color (in order to spend them in the
interesting ways) by cooperation.  It's a lot less efficient than
earning VCs of a second color oneself, so there's still the incentive
to partake of more than one in-game activity.]
