Append the following to rule 2193, modified from rule 1681:

     There is a format of the Monsterset known as the Short Logical
     Monsterset (SLM).  In this format, each Monster is assigned to a
     category, and the Monsters are grouped according to their category.

     Monsters are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
     categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
     categories removed, as the Monsterkeepor sees fit.
