Amend Rule 2166 (Assets) by appending to the final paragraph the text:

     A class of assets is public if its backing document is a rule or
     a public contract; otherwise it is private.

     The Accountor's report includes a list of all classes of assets,
     and their backing documents and recordkeepors.

with this text:

     The Accountor's report includes a list of all public classes of
     assets and their backing documents and recordkeepors.

and by replacing this text, if it exists:

     The Accountor is the default recordkeepor for all assets whose
     backing document does not specify a different recordkeepor.

with this text:

     The Accountor is the default recordkeepor for all public classes
     of assets whose backing document does not specify a different
     recordkeepor.
