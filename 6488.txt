Amend Rule 2259 (Hand Limits) by appending this text:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, each dealer
      of a basic deck SHALL by announcement audit each entity who owns
      at least as many cards from that basic deck as any other entity.

[This was removed between the first and second drafts of Proposal 6448.]
