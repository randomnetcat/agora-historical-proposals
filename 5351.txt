Adoption index: 1.7

Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by inserting this text before the
paragraph starting with "GUILTY":

      * UNAWARE, appropriate if the defendant violated the specified
        rule via the specified action, but reasonably believed at the
        time that e was not violating a rule

[Identical to Proposal 5319, except this time with sufficient AI to
amend Rule 1504 successfully.]
