Amend Rule 2126, removing:
      (6) During Agora's Birthday, a player CAN spend Notes forming
          the melody "Happy Birthday" (GGAGCB GGAGDC GGGECBA FFECDC or
          a translation thereof) to satisfy the Winning Condition of
          Musicianship,
and renumbering the following sections.

Create a new Power 2 rule entitled "Hats" with the following text:
      Party Hats are a class of fixed assets, tracked by the
      Conductor. Party hats can only be created as described in
      this rule.

      A player CAN spend Notes forming the melody "Happy
      Birthday" (GGAGCB GGAGDC GGGECBA FFECDC or a translation
      thereof) to create a Party Hat in eir own possession.

      During Agora's Birthday, a player CAN destroy a Party Hat
      in eir own possession to satisfy the Winning Condition of
      Celebration.

[[Creates a way for players saving Notes for a long time to win on
Agora's Birthday without making us wait a month and a half to replace
Notes, although people who are close to having the required Notes will
probably want to hold up completely replacing them for a little while
unless the replacement introduces a new way to get a Hat with a
transition of existing Notes to partially fulfill the new
requirements.]]
