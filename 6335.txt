Proposal: fix favoring bug (AI=2)

Amend the paragraph of Rule 1868 by replacing:
      A player CAN favor or disfavor a judicial case by announcement.
      When assigning a judge to a judicial case, the CotC, if
      possible, SHALL assign a player who has favored it and SHALL NOT
      assign a player who has disfavored it.
with:
      A player CAN favor or disfavor a judicial case by announcement.
      When assigning a judge to a judicial case, the CotC SHALL
      assign a player who has favored it and SHALL NOT assign a player
      who has disfavored it, as long as this is POSSIBLE and LEGAL.

[If a poorly qualified player favors a case, the CotC would be
required to assign em despite it being ILLEGAL to do so.]
