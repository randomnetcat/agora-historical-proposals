Amend rule 789 "Orders to Annotate Rules" by replacing the paragraph
that begins "The Judge of any CFJ" with:

        The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that a Rule
        should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE
        or FALSE, may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the
        Rulekeepor to annotate the Rule in question accordingly.  If the
        CFJ was judged TRUE then the annotation shall be the Statement
        of the CFJ, and if the CFJ was judged FALSE then the annotation
        shall be the contrary of the Statement of the CFJ.  Such an
        annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of that  
Rule.
