Amend Rule 2034 (Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges) by
replacing this text:

     A public document purporting to resolve an Agoran decision is
     self-ratifying.

with this text:

     A public document purporting to resolve an Agoran decision
     constitutes self-ratifying claims that

       a) such a decision existed,
       b) it was resolved as indicated, and
       c) (if the matter indicated was whether to adopt a proposal) the
            proposal was not prevented from taking effect.

[Mostly to guard against undetected committee rejections.]
