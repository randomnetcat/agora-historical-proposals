Amend Rule 2145 (Partnerships) by appending this text:

      A partnership's extended basis is the set consisting of the
      union of the set of its member persons with the extended
      bases of each of its partnership members.

      A partnership is second-class if its extended basis contains
      only non-players, third-class if its extended basis contains
      both players and non-players, or fourth-class if its extended
      basis contains only players.
