Amend Rule 2246 (Submitting a CFJ to the Justiciar) to read:

      The initiator of a judicial case CAN submit it to the Justiciar
      by announcement.  For such a case, the Justiciar CAN, in a timely
      manner, either accept or reject the case by announcement; until
      this time limit expires or the Justiciar rejects the case, the
      CotC CANNOT perform any of eir office's duties with regards to
      the case and does not incur any of eir office's obligations with
      regards to it.

      If the Justiciar accepts the case, e switches places with the
      CotC entirely with regards to that case; that is, e receives all
      obligations and all powers that the CotC would otherwise receive
      due to being CotC, and the CotC receives all obligations and
      powers that the Justiciar would otherwise receive due to being
      Justiciar. This includes any secondary duties required to fulfill
      obligations (such as rotating the bench). This takes precedence
      over Rules that would otherwise assign duties and powers
      regarding a judicial case to the Clerk of the Courts or the
      Justiciar due to holding one of those positions. A player CAN
      deputize for Justiciar to perform these duties as if it were an
      office.

      All persons are ENCOURAGED to submit a case to the Justiciar
      only when there is a good reason not to let it be processed by
      the Clerk of the Courts as usual.
