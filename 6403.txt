Amend Rule 2154 (Elections) by removing the text "PRESENT and ".

Amend Rule 2196 (Standard Classes of Agoran Decisions) by replacing
"FOR, AGAINST, and PRESENT" with "FOR and AGAINST".

Amend Rule 955 (Determining the Will of Agora) by removing the text ",
not counting votes of PRESENT"

Amend Rule 693 (Voting on Agoran Decisions) by inserting the following
paragraph after the bulleted list
{{
      When submitting a ballot, a player can select PRESENT rather than
      one of the options provided by the decision. A ballot cast for
      PRESENT is considered to be a valid ballot, but, unless specified
      otherwise, does not count as a valid option.
}}

Amend Rule 2127 (Conditional Votes) by removing the text ", or PRESENT
otherwise" in every instance where it appears, by removing the text
"; PRESENT is its own opposite", and by appending to the first paragraph
"If the option cannot be clearly identified, a vote of PRESENT is cast."

[Basically, folds PRESENT into a common option for all Agoran Decisions,
and makes conditional votes default to PRESENT, which they really should
anyways.]
