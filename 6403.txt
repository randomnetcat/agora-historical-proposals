In Rule 1607 (The Promotor), immediately after the paragraph beginning
"In a given Agoran week..." append the following paragraph:

      A player CAN flip a specified Interested proposal to
      Distributable without a number of objections equal to 4 - II
      (where II is the Interest Index of the specified proposal). A
      player CAN flip a specified Disinterested proposal to
      Distributable by announcement.llot, a player can select PRESENT rather than
      one of the options provided by the decision. A ballot cast for
      PRESENT is considered to be a valid ballot, but, unless specified
      otherwise, does not count as a valid option.
}}

Amend Rule 2127 (Conditional Votes) by removing the text ", or PRESENT
otherwise" in every instance where it appears, by removing the text
"; PRESENT is its own opposite", and by appending to the first paragraph
"If the option cannot be clearly identified, a vote of PRESENT is cast."

[Basically, folds PRESENT into a common option for all Agoran Decisions,
and makes conditional votes default to PRESENT, which they really should
anyways.]
