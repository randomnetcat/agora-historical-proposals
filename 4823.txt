Amend Rule 2040 by replacing the text that reads:

      Whenever a state ceases to be a state of a switch, all entities
      in the class that had previously been in that state shall be
      flipped to the default state of the switch.

with:

      Whenever a state ceases to be a state of a switch, all entities
      in the class that had previously been in that state shall be in
      the default state of the switch.
