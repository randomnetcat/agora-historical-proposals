Retitle rule 217 to "Interpreting the Rules" and amend it to read

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence.  Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense,
      past judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the
      game.

[This rule used to apply itself only to judgements, but actually this
part is applicable even when judgement is not invoked.  The second
paragraph, on the interpretation of the statement of a CFJ, is
obsolete, having been incorporated into the new version of rule 591.]
