[Linked CFJs become unlinked if the judge is automatically recused.
 They shouldn't.]

Amend Rule 2024 by replacing the text reading:

      If a Trial Judge is recused from a Linked CFJ, then it ceases to
      be Linked to any other CFJ.  If a Trial Judge is recused from
      two or more Linked CFJs in a single message, then those CFJs
      continue to be Linked to each other, but not to any other CFJs
      to which the Judge is still assigned.

with:

      If a Trial Judge is recused from a Linked CFJ, then it ceases to
      be Linked to any other CFJ.  If a Trial Judge is recused from
      two or more Linked CFJs in a single message, or if a Trial Judge
      is simultaneously and automatically recused from two or more
      Linked CFJs, then those CFJs continue to be Linked to each other,
      but not to any other CFJs to which the Judge is still assigned.
