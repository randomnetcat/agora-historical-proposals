Amend Rule 591 (Inquiry Cases) by replacing:

      An inquiry case CAN be initiated by any first-class person, by
      announcement which includes the statement to be inquired into.

with:

      Any first-class person CAN initiate an inquiry case by
      announcement, specifying a block of text which SHOULD represent
      a statement to be inquired into.

[As ais523 noted in eir judgement of CFJ 3243, most cases where
MALFORMED would be appropriate actually weren't validly initiated.]
