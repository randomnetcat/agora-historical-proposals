Amend Rule 2181 (The Accountor) by replacing the second paragraph
with this text:

      The Accountor is the default recordkeepor for all assets that do
      not specify a different recordkeepor.  If any such assets exist,
      then the Accountor's report includes a list of their backing
      documents; otherwise, the Accountor has no report.
