Amend Rule 2186 (Victory) by appending this text:

     While all but one player satisfy at least one Losing Condition,
     that player satisfies the Winning Condition of Solitude.

     Cleanup procedure:  The same person cannot satisfy this Winning
     Condition again until at least one other player ceases to satisfy
     any Losing Condition.

[We need some more Losing Conditions to make this interesting.]
