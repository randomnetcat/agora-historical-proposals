Amend rule 2126 by appending to the list of ways that VCs can be
gained (and lost, if both are in a single list) the new item

      (+U) When a player wins the game, e gains two ultraviolet VCs.

[This has an interesting interaction with the win-by-palette proposal:
it means that someone has to win in some other way first before a win
by palette can occur.  Adds to the bragging rights of a
champion-by-palette.]
