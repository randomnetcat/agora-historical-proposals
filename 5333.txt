Title: Regularity Regarding Rubicon Rosters
Author: root

Adoption index: 2

Amend the rule titled "The Senate" by inserting between the second
and third paragraphs a new paragraph reading:

      The roll call of an emergency session is the set of senators at
      the time the emergency session was called.  During emergency
      session, the previous definition of senator does not apply;
      instead, any player who is a member of the roll call is a
      senator.

If the proposal titled "Rubicon Reporting" was adopted, further amend
the same rule by appending to the paragraph just created the text:

      The Assessor's report includes the roll call of the most recent
      emergency session.

[A player cannot become a senator during an emergency session.]
