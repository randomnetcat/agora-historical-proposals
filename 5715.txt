Create a rule titled "Judicial Declarations" with Power 1.7 and
this text:

      A judicial declaration published by a judge as required by
      the rules in conjunction with a judgement is self-ratifying,
      provided that that judgement remains in effect.  Such a
      judgement may be inappropriate due to the content of this
      declaration, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
