Adoption index: 3.0

Append the following text to paragraph 2 of Rule 106:

      The Promotor CAN, by announcement, remove an undistributable
      proposal from the Proposal Pool that has continuously been in
      the Proposal Pool for the preceeding 30 days.

[This allows the Promotor to unclutter eir report by removing
proposals that nobody cares about anymore. If anyone does actually
care about those proposals, they can always just be resubmitted.]
