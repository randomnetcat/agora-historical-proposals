[Zefram is trying to repeal the Speaker's traditional role as
default officeholder, so what should the Speaker do instead?  Keep
track of speech, obviously.]

Change the title of Rule 2149 to "Truthiness, or the Island of
Knights and Knaves", and amend it to read:

      Truthiness is a player switch with values Knight (default)
      and Knave, tracked by the Speaker.

      A knight SHALL NOT publish statements that e believes are
      false.  A knave SHOULD NOT publish statements that e
      believes are true.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, Eris becomes a knave.
