Amend Rule 1686 by changing it to read:

      The Rules may designate certain information to be part of an
      Office's Weekly Report or Monthly Report.  An Office's Weekly
      Reports and Monthly Reports constitute the Office's Official
      Report.  All information that is part of an Office's Official
      Report shall be maintained by the corresponding officer.

      The rules may specify conditions under which a player is mauve;
      that player is not mauve unless the rules explicitly state at
      least one such condition and all such conditions are satisfied.
      As soon as possible after a player becomes mauve, the Speaker
      shall announce this fact.  The only condition for mauveness is
      being nicknamed Blob.

      Each officer with a Weekly Report must publish it weekly; each
      officer with a Monthly Report must publish it monthly.  Failure
      to do so is the Class 2 Infraction of Failure to Report.  If an
      officer fails to do so for at least three consecutive reporting
      periods, e may be cited for either Failure to Report or the
      Class 10 Infraction of Dereliction of Duty but not both.  Any
      officer cited for Dereliction of Duty is immediately removed
      from that office. The Assistant Director of Personnel and the
      Speaker may report these Infractions.
