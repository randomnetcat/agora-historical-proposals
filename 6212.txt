Amend rule 217 (Interpreting the rules) by replacing:

      it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense, past
      judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the game.

with:

      it is to be augmented by consideration of the best interests of
      the game (so that it does not cause the game to become unplayable,
      but not taking into account any other factors yet), game custom,
      past judgements, and common sense, in that order.
