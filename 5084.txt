Amend rule 649 by replacing the text

      As soon as possible after the Rules state that a Patent title
      shall be awarded or revoked, the Herald shall publicly award or
      revoke that Patent Title.

with

      As soon as possible after a patent title is awarded or revoked,
      the herald SHALL announce the award or revocation.

[We really don't need the extra step of the herald performing the
award or revocation.  It was poorly specified anyway.]
