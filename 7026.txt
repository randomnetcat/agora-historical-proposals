Amend Rule 2337 (Promises) by replacing this text:

     Optionally, the author CAN, in the creating message, specify a
     set of conditions required to be true for the promise to be
     cashed.

with this text:

     Optionally, the author CAN, in the creating message, specify
     one or more conditions required to be true for the promise to be
     cashed, and/or one or more conditions required to be true for
     the promise not to be destroyed when cashed.

Amend Rule 2338 (Cashing Promises) by replacing this text:

     A Player CAN cash a promise in eir possession by announcing that
     e does so, provided either that the promise has no conditions,
     or all of the conditions of the promise are true.

with this text:

     A Player CAN cash a promise in eir possession by announcing that
     e does so, provided either that all conditions required to be
     true for the promise to be cashed are true, or it has no such
     conditions.

and by replacing this text:

               Cashing a promise destroys it, unless the conditions
     of the promise explicitly and clearly include conditions under
     which the promise is not so destroyed, and these conditions are
     true.

with this text:

               Cashing a promise destroys it, unless the promise has
     at least one condition required to be true for it not to be
     destroyed when cashed, and all such conditions are true.
