Amend Rule 2333 (Contests) by replacing:
   Upon an announcement by the contestmaster
with:
   Upon a true announcement by the contestmaster

[This means the victory announcement can be CoE'd based on
whether or not the contest was truly won.  Ratification of
the win still happens via the ratification of the victory
announcement].
