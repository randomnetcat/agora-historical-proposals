Amend Rule 1006 ("Offices") by deleting the paragraph that starts "If
an Officer or the Speaker fails to satisfy a Timing Order".

Amend Rule 1794 ("Classes of Orders") by deleting item (d).

Create a rule titled "Default Timing" in the category "Definitions"
with the text:

        Where the Rules oblige a person to perform some action but do
        not otherwise specify a time limit by which the action must be
        performed, the action must be performed as soon as possible
        after the first instant when both the person was obliged to
        perform that action and the action was logically possible.
