Amend the Rule titled "Agoran Contracts" to read:

      There exists a type of Contract known as Agoran Contract
      (hereafter, "AC"). All ACs must have a title. The Regulations of
      an AC must clearly state the area of authority of that AC, which
      can be one of the following:

        (i) An Office and Agora.
       (ii) Any entity and Agora.
      (iii) Any two or more entities.

      An Agoran Contract may only be created, repealed or amended by a
      Sane Proposal and becomes effective when the Proposal takes
      effect. When an AC between an entity and Agora becomes
      effective, all Players automatically become Members of that AC,
      any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The ADoP is required to keep track of all ACs between an Office
      and Agora. The Registrar is required to keep track of all ACs
      between any entity and Agora. The Justiciar is required to keep
      track of all ACs between any two or more entities.

      All Rules regulating Contracts that are inconsistent with this
      Rule are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

      (f) The list of all Agoran Contracts and their Regulations
          between an Office and Agora.

Amend Rule 910 (The Justiciar) by appending the following:

      The Justiciar's Weekly Report shall include the following:

      (i) The list of all Agoran Contracts and their Regulations
          between any two or more entities.
