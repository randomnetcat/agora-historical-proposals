Title: SURRENDER DOROTHY
Author: Fool

Enact a new power 3 rule with the following text:
  {{
Fool CAN cause this rule to amend itself by announcement, provided he
states that he does so in the name of Davy I, Queen of Agora Nomic, CAT
24, and her other realms.
  }}

[ Same as failed prop 7494, but removed the controversial clause "Fool
SHALL respect the long tradition of players relinquishing the
dictatorship after a time and not actually abusing it." I expect this
will pass now. ]
