      (h) The announcer, by virtue of the announcement of intent,
          implicitly submits a ballot of SUPPORT on the Agoran
          decision, if e is an eligible voter and does not explicitly
          repudiate this implication in the announcement.

[Long overdue fix for partnerships being able to perform actions with
less support than the rules intend.  Now the "with N support" really
means that N+1 first-class players must be supporting the action; this
requirement is the same whether the announcer is first-class or not.
There's no advantage in using a second-class announcer.  The implicit
vote mechanism used to implement this seems neater than the
alternative formulations.]
