Title: Interest Index

Adoption index: 2

Change the title of Rule 2153 to "Interest Index", and amend it to read:

      The interest index of a proposal is an integer from 0 to 3.  It
      CAN be set by the proposer at the time of submission, or otherwise
      defaults to 1.  A proposal's interest index SHOULD be proportional
      to its complexity.

      "Disinterested" is a synonym for "interest index 0".  A proposal
      SHOULD be disinterested if and only if its effects are limited
      to correcting errors and/or ambiguities.

Amend Rule 2126 (Voting Credits) by replacing "the integer portion of
the proposal's adoption index" with "the proposal's adoption index times
its interest index (rounded down to the nearest integer)".
