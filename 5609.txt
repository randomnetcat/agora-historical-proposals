Adoption index: 2

Amend Rule 2154 (Replacing Officers) by replacing this text:

      A player who has not refused eir nomination is a consenting
      candidate.

with this text:

      A consenting candidate is a player who was nominated during
      the first half of the nominating period and did not refuse,
      or who was nominated during the second half and accepted.

[Hypothetical situation:  I nominate myself and refuse.  3 days and
23 hours later, I nominate another player; under the current system,
that player has only 1 hour to refuse.]
