Amend Rule 2286 (Veto and Rubberstamp) to read:

      Vetoing an ordinary decision during its voting period increases
      its adoption index by 3 and makes it Democratic.  Vetoing a
      decision under other circumstances has no effect.

      Rubberstamping an ordinary, non-filibustered decision during its
      voting period decreases its quorum to 1, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.  Rubberstamping a decision under other
      circumstances has no effect.

      A player CAN veto or rubberstamp a specified ordinary decision
      for a fee of 3 ergs.
