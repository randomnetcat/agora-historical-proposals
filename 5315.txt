Amend Rule 1551 (Ratification) by replacing this text:

      Any public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
      ratified one week after its publication, unless explicitly
      challenged during that period.

with this text:

      Any public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
      ratified one week after its publication, unless explicitly and
      publicly challenged during that period via one of the following
      methods, explaining the scope and nature of the perceived error:

        a) An inquiry case, appropriate for questions of legal
           interpretation.

        b) A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact.  The
           publisher of the original document SHALL respond to a claim
           of error as soon as possible, either publishing a revision
           or denying the claim.  If e denies the claim, then the
           original document is ratified one week after the denial,
           unless it is challenged again (subject to the same
           requirements) during that period.
