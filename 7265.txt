In bullet point (d) of rule 1504, change "the Accused could have
reasonably believed that the alleged act did violate the specified rule"
to "the Accused should have reasonably believed that the alleged act did
violate the specified rule".

[When the rule was changed from being written in negatives to being
written in positives, the change in part (d) seems not to have taken De
Morgan's Law into account.]
