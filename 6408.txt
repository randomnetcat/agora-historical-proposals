Amend the rule entitled "Cards" by removing "Any office whose
      duties include being a dealer is a high-priority office (rules
      to the contrary notwithstanding), and holdings of cards from
      that deck are part of that officer's weekly report; a dealer's
      report of card holdings is self-ratifying."

[The bit about holdings being part of the report and self-ratifying are
 rather irrelevant as the rules for recordkeepors of assets already
 cover that.]

Amend the rule entitled  "Rule, Decks, Draws, and Salaries" by replacing
[N.B. for the Rulekeepor: this is not the entire paragraph.]
{{
      At the beginning of each
      week, each holder of a high-priority office who completed a non-
      empty set of duties in the prior week earns a number of draws
      from the deck indicated by the switch equal to the interest
      index for the office.  At the beginning of each month, each
      holder of a low-priority office who held the office for 16 or
      more days in the prior month earns a number of draws from the
      deck indicated by the switch equal to the interest index of the
      office.
