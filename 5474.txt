Amend Rule 1871 (The Standing Court) by replacing "within one week"
with "in a timely fashion".

[No functional change here, just eliminating a hardcoded value.]

Amend Rule 2158 (Judicial Questions) by replacing this text:

      When a judicial question is applicable and open, and its case
      has the same judge assigned to it, continuously for one week,
      the Clerk of the Courts CAN recuse that judge with cause by
      announcement.  When these conditions have all held continuously
      for two weeks, the Clerk of the Courts SHALL so recuse that
      judge as soon as possible.

with this text:

      When a judicial question is applicable and open, and its judge
      has violated a time limit to assign a judgement to it, the Clerk
      of the Courts SHALL recuse that judge with cause by announcement
      as soon as possible; however, this requirement is waived if the
      judge assigns a judgement to it first.

[This eliminates two hardcoded values, and also speeds up the CotC's
requirement to recuse and reassign.]
