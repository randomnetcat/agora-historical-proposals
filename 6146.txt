Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by removing this text:

                                           If the Accused is found to
       be NOT GUILTY after a number of rests have been created in eir
       possession due to the notice in question, the judge CAN and
       SHALL destroy any such rests by announcement as soon as
       possible.

and inserting this paragraph immediately afterward:

     When a judicial question on culpability is judged after a number
     of rests have been created in the Accused's possession due to the
     associated notice, the judge CAN and SHALL destroy any such rests
     by announcement as soon as possible.
