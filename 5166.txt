Amend rule 2126 by inserting in the list of ways that VCs can be
gained (and lost, if both are in a single list), immediately after the
last item that mentions green VCs, the new item

      (+C) When a player deputises for an office e gains one cyan VC,
           unless someone previously gained a VC in this manner for
           the same office in the same month.

[The cyan VC would of course usually be gained at the expense of
someone else's green VC.]
