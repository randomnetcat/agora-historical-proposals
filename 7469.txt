Amend Rule 2350 (Proposals) by replacing "Once a proposal is created,
none of its attributes can be changed." with "Once a proposal is
created, but before it is distributed, changing its attributes is
secured with power threshold 2.5. Once a proposal is distributed, none
of its attributes can be changed."

Enact a new power-2.5 rule entitled "Proposal Edits" reading "The
author of a proposal in the Proposal Pool CAN, with 2 support, edit
the text, title, chamber, or AI of the proposal."
