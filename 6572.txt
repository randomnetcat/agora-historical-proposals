Create a new rule titled "Molting the Moats" (Power=2) with the text:
{{
The End-Times are Near.

Any player CAN elevate any rule by announcement that e has not
elevated before.

Seven days or later after the adoption of the proposal that created this
rule, any player CAN Declare That the End-Times are Here by
announcement. This causes the 20 rules elevated most often elevated to
be repealed, not counting rules which have never been elevated. The
End-Times then cease to be Here, and this rule repeals itself.
