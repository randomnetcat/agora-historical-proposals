Amend Rule 1728 (Dependent Actions) by replacing this text:

      (b) either the performer was the initiator,

with this text:

      (b) either the performer was the initiator, or the action depends
          on support and the performer has supported the action and the
          rule allowing the action to be performed dependently does not
          explicitly prohibit supporters from performing it,

[The remainder of (b), allowing the holder of a rule-defined position
to complete an attempt initiated by a predecessor, is left unchanged.]

[Note that the second judgement of CFJ 1932 went unappealed because
comex got enough support, but didn't act on it.  This same trend was
pointed out a few years ago wrt legislation; if you publish a proto
and then fail to follow up, other players will generally leave the
subject alone until one of them decides you've dropped the ball.]
