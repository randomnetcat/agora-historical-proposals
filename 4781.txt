Create a power 3 rule entitled "Win by Paradox" with the text:

      If the legality of an action cannot be determined with finality,
      or if by a Judge's best reasoning, not appealed within a week of
      eir Judgement, an action appears equally legal and illegal, then
      the Speaker shall award the Patent Title of Champion to the
      first Player to publicly note that condition.  The Herald shall
      record that this Title was achieved "by paradox" in eir report.
