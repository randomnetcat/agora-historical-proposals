Title: partially regularise speakership
Author: Zefram

Adoption index: 1

Amend rule 402 by deleting the paragraphs that start "If an active
player" and "A speaker who became".

[Proposal 5145 to fully regularise the speakership is being rejected
at AI=3, but at the time of writing has a majority of votes in favour.
Reminder of rationale: as the speakership has lost almost all of its
executive power, transmuted into a figurehead with (currently) a minor
administrative duty, there's no reason for the special provisions
regarding installation into office.

This proposal simplifies the speakership significantly, at AI=1,
omitting (from P5145) only the repeal of rule 103 which provides for
the speakership to be magically never vacant.  The provisions being
deleted concern installation of game winners into office and a
restriction on replacing the speaker.]
