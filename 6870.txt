Create a new Power-3 rule titled "Messy Statements":

      A statement is messy if its truth value cannot be evaluated in a
      top-down fashion without encountering some form of infinite
      regress, such as (but not limited to) self-reference.

      For the purposes of the rules, messy statements are considered
      inaccurate and incorrect regardless of their truth value.

Amend Rule 2215 (Truthiness) by replacing "believes that it is true"
with "believes that it is accurate".

Award a win to Bucky, because eir paradox is worthy of one, but
setting up the circumstances to make a CFJ legitimately UNDECIDABLE is
hard.
