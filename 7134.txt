     * Any Elder CAN flip any non-Elder to supine by announcement;
     * Any Elder CAN flip any office held by a non-Elder to Assumed by
       announcement;
     * Non-Elders CANNOT Assume offices, even if other rules say they
       can;
     * Any Elder, with 4 Elder Support, CAN set the Adoption Index of
       any Agoran Decision with an Adoption Index to 4294967296.
