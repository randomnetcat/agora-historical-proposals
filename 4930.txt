Enact the following rule:

   If a single player has a voting power on ordinary
   proposals equal to or greater than the total voting
   power on ordinary proposals of all other players
   combined, that player wins the game upon any player
   announcing the fact.

[
We need wins.  This is simple, uses a mechanism already
in play.  A player getting to that point could pass a
proposal declaring emself the winner.  Except (1) quorum and
(2) e wouldn't want to, because e'd lose eir votes.  This
makes em the winner, with the added strategy that you could
push someone who wants to keep eir votes over the edge.
