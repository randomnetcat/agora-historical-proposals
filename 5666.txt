If the proposal titled "Chambers II" fails this proposal has no effect.

Create a new rule titled "Proposal Auction" with Power=1 and the text:
{{
There exists an Auction chamber. The eligible voters on an auction
decision are the players. The voting limit of an eligible voter on an
auction decision is equal to the number of Points that player owns
minus the number of valid ballots e has cast on any other auction
proposals which are still in their voting period.

When the voting period of an auction decision ends each player loses a
number of points equal to the number of valid ballots e cast on that
decision.
