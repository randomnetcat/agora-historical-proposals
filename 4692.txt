Create a new rule titled "The New Raffle", reading:

      The following class of cards is defined:

      * Caption: Raffle Ticket
        Elements: Grafty

      As soon as possible after the 13th day of the third month of
      each quarter, the Deckmastor shall randomly select a copy of a
      Raffle Ticket in the possession of a Player and announce eir
      selection, unless no such copy exists.  Upon this announcement,
      the Player in possession gains three instances of the ephemeral
      Patent Title "Fortune's Fool", and each Raffle Ticket in the
      possession of a Player is automatically discarded.
