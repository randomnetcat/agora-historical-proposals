Amend Rule 478 (Fora) by appending:

      Forcibly modifying the interpretation of text in public messages
      is secured.  This does not prevent rules from providing
      non-binding definitions and interpretation guidance for such
      messages.

[If a low-powered rule said that "AGAINST" is to be interpreted as
"FOR", would it conflict with Rule 478 (or some other rule)?  There's
the requirement that the action be "unambiguous" and "clear", so I
guess a message purporting to vote AGAINST might be thrown out, but
that's still a denial of service.  There's the innocuous phrase
"announcing that e performs it", since the low-powered rule might be
interpreted as purporting to make someone do something by announcing
that e does something else, but it's far from clear to me that would
actually conflict.  Anyway, here's some explicit wording.]
