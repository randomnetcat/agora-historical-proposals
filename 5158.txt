Adoption index: 2

Whereas Agora has historically been ruled by a monarch with a variety
of prerogative powers,

and whereas this position of Evil Overlord^W^WSpeaker has lost its
former importance as a vital administrative post,

and whereas Agora's present democratic inclinations are ill-matched by
the embodiment of executive power in an individual player,

and whereas player Zefram has in recent months engaged in a programme
of systematically stripping the Speaker of eir powers and practical
duties,

and whereas only one more prerogative power remains to be repealed
before Agora will be truly democratic, with its head of state being
entirely non-executive in nature,

and whereas the Rubber Stamp is a strange power of little legitimate
use,

rule 2019 is hereby repealed.
