Amend Rule 2387 (Ribbons) by adding the following paragraph after
the paragraph that begins (+V):

      (+W) A Player CANNOT earn a White Ribbon.  A Player CANNOT earn
           a White Ribbon if e holds the Patent Title Renascent.


Amend Rule 2387 (Ribbons) by appending the following paragraph:

       A Player who holds the Patent Title Renascent, CAN, with 2
       Support, if e has never done so, cause this rule to amend itself
       by replacing the sentence between (+W) and "A Player CANNOT earn
       a White Ribbon if e holds the Patent Title Renascent." with a
       different, specified sentence that solely contains a means for
       earning a White Ribbon.
