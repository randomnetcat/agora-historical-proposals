Title: Classic Nomic Ribbon
Author: G.
Co-authors: 
Adoption index: 1

Amend Rule 2387 (Ribbons) by replacing:

      (+L) A player qualifies for a Lime Ribbon, if e was the
           co-author of at least three Proposals adopted in the
           previous week.
with:
      (+L) If a proposal is adopted, and if only one Player
           other that the proposal's author cast (and did not
           retract) one or more valid votes AGAINST the proposal,
           than both the casting player and the author of the
           proposal earn a Lime Ribbon.

[vc awards now make multiple co-author proposals too worthwhile
and a simple little scam with lots of little proposals.  Therefore
changing the ribbon award to a classic nomic Prisoners' Dilemma].
