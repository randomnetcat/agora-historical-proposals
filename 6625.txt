Amend Rule 106 by replacing this text:

     Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change.

with this text:

     Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change;
     this does not apply to generally preventing changes to specified
     areas of the gamestate, nor to a proposal preventing itself from
     taking effect (its no-effect clause is generally interpreted as
     applying only to the rest of the proposal).
