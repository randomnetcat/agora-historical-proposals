Adoption index: 1.0


The Anarchist's proposals are rarely accepted. This proposal proposes
two changes, both of which serve the purpose of having the Anarchist's
proposals actually be accepted. First, the Anarchist is given the power
to select the rules e wishes to repeal rather than having to randomly
select some (which will often net em with having rules that nobody wants
to repeal). Second, it gives the Anarchist the power to submit other
relevant changes, so as not to leave the rules in disarray if any of eir
proposals are to be accepted. These changes should dramatically
increase the adoption rate of the Anarchist's proposals.

Amend Rule 2216 (The Repeal-o-Matic) to read:

      The Anarchist is an office; its holder is responsible for
      proposing the repeal of rules.

      The Anarchist's weekly duties include picking one or more rules
      and submitting proposals to repeal each of those rules. The
      Anarchist SHOULD include in eir proposals other relevant changes
      so as not to have negative effects on the Rules. The Anarchist
      SHALL NOT submit a proposal to repeal a rule for which e already
      submitted a proposal to repeal within the last month. The
      adoption index of each of the Anarchist's proposals is equal to
      the maximum power of the rule e is to amend.

      The Anarchist's monthly report includes a list of the titles and
      texts of the proposals e submitted as part of eir weekly duties
      in the preceding month.
