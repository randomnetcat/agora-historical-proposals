Create the following rule, entitled Do It On Time
{{{
     When a rule requires a player to complete an action, a player
     SHALL complete the action with regards to the circumstances at the
     time the action was first required. This is considered part of the
     obligation to perform the action, and not a separate obligation.

     If a player believes the action was incorrect due to changing
     circumstances, e SHALL take the required action, while stating
     that with N Agoran Consent, where N is an integral multiple of 0.1
     from 2.0 to 9.9, e intends to retract the required action e
     performed and instead perform another one. Such a change is not
     retroactive, and as such it may only be possible to partially
     retract the earlier action. If this is the case, the inability to
     complete part of the retraction does not hamper the remainder of
     the action.
