Amend R2069 by replacing the text:
     A Gambler whose Hand Size is smaller than the maximum Hand Size,
     plus the number of Offices e holds, plus one if e is Speaker, may
     draw a card from The Deck.  The fee for this action is a number of
     Kudos equal to the number of times during the current month e has
     previously drawn a card in this manner.

With:
        A Gambler may Draw from The Deck only as permitted by the Rules.

Create a new rule titled "Normal Card Draws" with this text:

     A Gambler whose Hand is not Full may draw a card from The Deck. 
     The fee for this action is a number of Kudos equal to the number of
     times during the current month e has previously drawn a card 
     under the provisions of this rule.

      equal to or greater than the Maximum Hand Size plus the number of
      offices e holds.   For the purposes of this rule Speakership is
      considered an office.
