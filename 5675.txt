Amend Rule 2169 by replacing:
     When an applicable question on equation in an equity case has a
     judgement, and has had that judgement continuously for the past
     week (or all parties to the contract have approved that
     judgement), the judgement is in effect as a binding agreement
     between the parties.  In this role it is subject to modification
     or termination by the usual processes governing binding
     agreements.

     An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in an equity
     case within the past week CAN be initiated by any party to the
     contract in question by announcement.

with:
     When an applicable question on equation in an equity case has a
     judgement, and has had that judgement continuously for the past
     week (or all parties to the contract have approved that
     judgement), the judgement becomes Enforceable as a set of
     regulated requirements imposed by this Rule.

     Every party to the contract SHALL act to ensure the terms of
     an enforceable equity judgement specific to that party are
     satisfied, though this requirement does not create the ability
     to perform regulated actions that the party CANNOT otherwise
     perform.

     If a party fails to act as specified, e is in violation of this
     Rule; in such a situation, the judge CAN act on the party's behalf
     to fulfill said obligations Without 3 Objections, or the party may
     be subjected to a criminal punishment other than DISCHARGE for
     violating this Rule, but not both.

     The judge CAN, Without Objection from the parties, nullify a
     specified term or terms of the judgement, thereby removing the
     requirement of parties to act as specified.

     An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in an equity
     case CAN be initiated by any party to the contract in question
     by announcement.  If the judgement is Enforceable when it is
     appealed, the Appeals Court SHOULD assume that the judgement was
     fundamentally fair when made, and SHALL restrict its appeals
     judgement to nullifying terms of the judgement which are no
     longer applicable due to changed circumstances.
