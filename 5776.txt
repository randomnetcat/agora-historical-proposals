Amend Rule 2145 by appending the following text:

   If a judge finds a partnership guilty in a criminal proceedings,
   e may sentence one or more members of the partnership for the
   crime rather than the partnership itself.  To be an appropriate
   sentence in this case, the judge SHOULD use the text of the
   partnership as a guide to the devolution of sentencing but
   is not bound to follow the text if it is unclear on the subject
   or would not adequately apply responsibility.
