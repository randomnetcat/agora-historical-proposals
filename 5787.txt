Title: Fix OVERLOOKED
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: Ivan Hope, Pavitra
Adoption index: 1.7

Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing this text:

     * OVERLOOKED, appropriate if the alleged act allegedly occurred
       at least 200 days before the case was initiated

with this text:

     * OVERLOOKED, appropriate if the initiating announcement alleged
       a rule breach at least 200 days before the case was initiated

[Closes the loophole where the defendant can force OVERLOOKED by
falsely alleging that the breach occurred a long time ago.]
