Create a rule titled "Truthfulness" with Power 2 and this text:

     A person SHALL NOT make a public statement on a matter relevant
     to the rules that is intended to mislead others as to its truth
     (or, in the case of a public statement that one performs an
     action, its effectiveness).

     For the purpose of this rule:

       a) Merely quoting a statement does not constitute making
          that statement.

       b) Any conditional clause or other qualifier attached to a
          statement constitutes part of the statement; the nature of
          the whole is what is significant.

[A proposal to amend a rule into this form was previously adopted,
but another proposal had repealed that rule first.]
