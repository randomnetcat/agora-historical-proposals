If rubles are not a currency, then this proposal has no effect.

Create a rule titled "Legal Fees" with Power 2 and this text:

     Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, if at least five judicial
     cases have been created earlier in the week, then creating a
     judicial case has a cost of 1 ruble.

     However, the above notwithstanding, a judicial case has no cost
     if it is the first case initiated by that person that week, or if
     it is an appeal case.
