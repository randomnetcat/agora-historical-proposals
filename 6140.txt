Amend Rule 2234 (Rewarding Contestmasters) by replacing:
                         where N is the number of players who were
     contestants of that contest at any time during that month.
with:
                         where N is either the number of players who
     were contestants of that contest at any time during that month,
     or the number of points awarded by that contest on that axis
     during that month, whichever is less.
