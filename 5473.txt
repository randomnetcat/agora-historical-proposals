Amend Rule 591 (Inquiry Cases) by replacing this text:

      * UNDECIDABLE, appropriate if the statement was logically
        undecidable or otherwise not capable of being accurately
        described as either false or true, at the time the inquiry
        case was initiated

with this text:

      * UNDECIDABLE, appropriate if the statement was logically
        self-contradictory (could not be accurately described as
        either true or false), contingent (could not be accurately
        described as either not true or not false), or otherwise
        undecidable, at the time the inquiry case was initiated
