[Now for repeals.  These are based on random repeals generated from a
script that would have had Bayes propose them.  However, ehird rather
dislikes the idea, so I think that's scrapped.  Anyway, these have
been manually edited, whereas the raw random repeals would often make
the ruleset nonsensical.]
Amend Rule 478 (Fora) by removing:
      Each active player should ensure e can receive messages via each
      public forum.
