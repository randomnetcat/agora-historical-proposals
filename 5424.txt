If any part of this proposal cannot take effect, then the proposal as
a whole shall have no effect.

Enact a rule with title "Ribbons", power 2, and the same text as rule
2126.

Retitle rule 2126 to "Notes", and amend it to have the same text as
rule 2194.

Repeal rule 2194.

[Overall effect: notes, the replacement for VCs, go in the rule that
defined VCs and has all the VC history.  Ribbons, the new concept,
go in a new rule.]
