Amend the first sentence of Rule 2154 (Election Procedure) to read:

      Any player CAN, with support (or by announcement if e is the
      IADoP), initiate an election for a specified elected office for
      which no election is already in progress.

[This alleviates the issue where in some cases the IADoP is required to
initiate an election but cannot unless e recevies support.]
