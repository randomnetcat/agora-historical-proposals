Amend Rule 478 (Fora) by removing:

      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the
      time date-stamped on that message.

and by appending:

      The timing of an action performed by sending a message is
      determined as follows:

      (1) If the message contains a single reasonable date-stamp added
          by the forum (if any) as part of its canonical means of
          marking the date of messages, then it is used; otherwise,
      (2) if the message contains at least one reasonable date-stamp
          added by the forum (if any), then the latest one is used;
          otherwise,
      (3) the true time of the message is used.

      The true time of a message sent via a forum is the time when the
      forum started to make it available to other players.  The true
      time of a message sent manually to all players is the time when
      the last copy was sent.  A reasonable date-stamp is one that can
      reasonably be determined to be within one minute of the true
      time.

      If a message is sent independently via multiple means, then the
      earliest of the timings considering each such copy of the
      message is used.

[(1) applies to lists with date rewriting or any other forum with a
canonical date (e.g. a web message board with a date field);
 (2) applies to Received headers in lieu of a canonical stamp;
 (3) applies if nothing else is available, such as if an IRC channel
is made public again.

This does not give any credence to original Date headers, because they
are trivially fakeable.  If recordkeepors would like to use them in
reports, there should be nothing wrong with using them anyway, with
the implication that the time is approximate, but if it becomes
necessary to find the exact time of a particular message, there is no
reason not to use the Received header.  And of course date rewriting
makes this easier.]
