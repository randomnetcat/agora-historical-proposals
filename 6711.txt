COMMENTS:
I don't think this leads itself very easily to a proposal flood which
would be undemocratizable, as it would require a large number of Ergs
for it to work and could easily be defeated by the rest of Agora keeping
the proposals down with their ergs. In a worst-case scenario, it would
require an Emergency Session - but that is, after all, what Emergency
Sessions are for, is it not?

PROPOSAL TEXT:
Repeal Rule 2142 (Support Democracy).
Amend Rule 1607 by removing the sentence that reads:
       A player CAN flip a specified Disinterested proposal to
       Distributable by announcement.
