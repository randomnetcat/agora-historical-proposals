Amend Rule 1728 by replacing item (f) of the list in that rule with:
      (f) The vote collector of such a decision CANNOT resolve it if
          it was initiated more than fourteen days ago, or less than
          its urgency ago.
and appending to the list:
      (h) The urgency of such a decision is by default:
            * four days, if it has an objection and/or majority
              index;
            * zero days otherwise.

Amend Rule 2172 by replacing the entire text with:
      A player CAN perform an action on behalf of Agora with Agoran
      Consent.

      A player MAY perform an action on behalf of Agora with Agoran
      Consent.  For the decision of whether to approve this dependent
      action, the urgency is 24 hours.  This SHOULD only be done in
      cases where urgent action is required.
