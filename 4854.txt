Amend Rule 681 (Conditions for Conclavity) to read:

      A conclave must be convened if any of the following events have
      occurred since the last time a player became a pope, and no
      competing conclave is currently convened:

      (a) the Speaker has resigned the Speakership;

      (b) the Speaker has become inactive;

      (c) the Herald has confirmed an allegation that the Speaker is
          lawless;

      (d) a valid notice of deregistration naming the Speaker has been
          published;

      (e) the success of a Call for Revolt has been announced, and the
          Speaker was abiding at the time of the Call for Revolt, in
          which case the cardinals who were abiding at the time of the
          Call for Revolt are disqualified;

      (f) two or more cardinals have simultaneously won the game, in
          which case all other cardinals are disqualified;

      (g) no pope has become Speaker in the past six months; or

      (h) a pope has ceased to be pope without becoming Speaker.

      So there's always hope
      that you can be pope.

Amend Rule 786 (Default Procedure for Conclaves) by appending, after
this text:

      A cardinal is qualified for a conclave unless the rules specify
      otherwise.

this text:

      However, if a conclave would otherwise have no qualified
      cardinals, then all cardinals are qualified for the duration of
      that conclave.

and by removing the text "quorum is zero,".
