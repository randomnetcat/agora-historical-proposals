In Rule 2143, add the following paragraph at the end:

      Reports SHALL be published in plain text.  Tabular data must
      line up properly when viewed in a monospaced font.  Publishing
      reports that deviate from these regulations is the Class 6 Crime
      of Making My Eyes Bleed.

Replace the text of Rule 2139 with:

      The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of players.

      The Registrar's report includes:

      a) Information sufficient to identify and contact each player.
      b) The date on which each player most recently became a player.
      c) The Activity of each player, and when each Inactive player
         became Inactive.
      d) For each former player for which the
         information is reasonably available, the dates on which e
         registered and deregistered.
