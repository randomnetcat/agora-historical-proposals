Author: Murphy
Co-authors: 
Adoption index: 1.7

Amend Rule 2169 (Equity Cases) by replacing this text:

                                               An equity case CAN be
      initiated by any party to the contract, by announcement which
      clearly identifies the contract, the set of parties to the
      contract, and a state of affairs whereby events have not
      proceeded as envisioned by the contract (such as, but not
      limited to, a party acting in contravention of eir contractual
      obligations).

with this text:

                                               An equity case CAN be
      initiated by any party to the contract, by announcement which
      clearly identifies the contract and a state of affairs whereby
      events have not proceeded as envisioned by the contract (such as,
      but not limited to, a party acting in contravention of eir
      contractual obligations).  This announcement SHALL also clearly
      identify the set of parties to the contract.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, the gamestate becomes what it would
be if none of the following alleged equity cases failed to be initiated
solely because of an error in identifying the set of parties:

  1811, 1825, 1832, 1886, 1915, 1927, 1932, 2036, 2038, 2039, 2052, 2063
