This proposal has no effect unless proposals titled "Oligarch
in a Three-Piece Suit" and "Judicial Separation" have been adopted.

Create a rule titled "Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?" with this
text:

      Whenever the Speaker is Electee to the Office of Assistant
      Director of Personnel, e is retired from that Office.

      The Assistant Director of Personnel cannot be Nominated for
      the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Amend Rule 1647 (The Speaker-Elect) by removing this text:

      The Clerk of the Courts, Justiciar, and Assistant Director
      of Personnel cannot be Nominated for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.
