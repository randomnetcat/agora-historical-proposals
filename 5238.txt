Amend Rule 1871 (The Standing Court) by replacing the first three
paragraphs with this text:

      Posture is a player switch with values Standing, Sitting, Leaning,
      and Supine (default), tracked by the Clerk of the Courts.  A
      non-standing player CAN flip eir posture to any non-standing value
      by announcement.

      Hawkishness is a player switch with values Hanging, Hugging,
      and Hemming-and-Hawing (default), tracked by the Clerk of the
      Courts.  A player CAN flip eir hawkishness by announcement.

      A supine player is unqualified to be assigned as judge of any
      judicial case.  A sitting or leaning player is poorly qualified
      to be assigned as judge of any judicial case.

      A hanging player is unqualified to be assigned as judge of any
      inquiry case.  A hugging player is unqualified to be assigned as
      judge of any criminal case, and poorly qualified to be assigned
      as judge of any equity case.

      When a player is poorly qualified to be assigned as judge of a
      judicial case, the Clerk of the Courts SHALL not assign em to be
      the judge of that case; if e has done so, and that player is still
      the judge of that case, then e CAN recuse that judge from that
      case by announcement.

[Leaning players are candidates for judicial panels, but not for
non-appeal cases, hence they are not part of the sitting-to-standing
process.  "Poorly qualified" is generalized.]
