Create a new rule of Power 1, named Reports, with the following text:
{{{
     When a player is required to publish a report, e SHALL do so using
     one of the following methods:

       (1) By placing the text of the report in a public message.

       (2) By posting, in a public message, a URL or URLs to the
           publicly accessible text of the report.

     All reports shall be clearly identified as such by the player
     publishing them, along with its expiration date.

     If the text of a report was not placed in a public message, the
     text of the report must remain publicly accessible by at least
     one means at all times until it expires. A player CANNOT be held
     responsible for the inaccessibility of a report arising from
     circumstances beyond his control provided e republish it as soon
     as possible and withing 24 hours.

     A periodic report generally expires when the next such report is
     issued. A non-periodic report generally expires after one month.
     It is a Class-4 Crime to modify text identified as a report or to
     provide more than one location for a report with different texts,
     including republishing an inaccessible report with text different
     from the original.
