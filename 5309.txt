Rubicon

Enact a rule entitled "The Senate" with the following text and a
power of 2:

      A Senator is any Player who has been registered continuously for
      the immediately preceding sixty days.  The collection of Senators
      is the Senate.

      A Senator CAN call an Emergency Session with 2 Senate supporters,
      provided no other emergency session existed at any time in the
      preceding 48 hours.  An emergency session lasts for 21 days after
      being called.

      During emergency session, any Senator declare a filibuster on
      a proposal in its voting period, with 2 supporting Senators,
      provided no filibuster has been declared on that proposal in
      the past.  During emergency session, any Senator may end a
      filibuster on a proposal with 4 supporting Senators.

      A proposal that ends its voting period in filibuster has a
      quorum of the number of eligible voters plus 1, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding, and its voting period is not extended
      due to lack of quorum.

      When an emergency session begins, all non-Senators' postures
      become supine, and non-Senators CANNOT flip their posture
      while the session lasts.

[Filibuster is on once, off once.  Prevents the "race" if its used
to kill legitimate proposals.  Net result:  the invasion has to bribe
a quorum of Senators to get its proposals through, and a quorum of
Senators can end a coalition of Senators blocking legitimate proposals.
