Create a new rule titled "Precedence of Contracts" with Power 2 and
this text:

     In a conflict between a rule and a contract, or between two
     contracts:

       a) If the conflict pertains to obligation or prohibition, then
          neither entity takes precedence; it is up to the party to
          avoid such conflicts.  If the conflict pertains to existence
          or possibility, then the following clauses apply.

       b) In a conflict between a rule and a contract, the rule takes
          precedence.

       c) In a conflict between a public contract and a private
          contract, the public contract takes precedence.

       d) In a conflict between two public contracts, the one that has
          been public longer takes precedence.

       e) In a conflict between two private contracts, the older one
          takes precedence.

Amend Rule 1586 (Definition and Continuity of Entities) by replacing
this text:

     If multiple rules or contracts (hereafter documents) attempt to
     define an entity with the same name, then they refer to the same
     entity.  A document-defined entity's name CANNOT be changed to
     be the same as another document-defined entity.

with this text:

     If multiple rules and/or contracts (hereafter documents) attempt
     to define an entity with the same name, then only one succeeds in
     doing so; this constitutes a conflict, which is resolved according
     to precedence.  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the name of
     a document-defined entity CANNOT be changed to be the same as that
     of another document-defined entity, and a contract CANNOT be
     amended to define an entity already defined by a different public
     contract.

     If multiple documents attempt to refer to an entity with the same
     name, then they refer to the same entity.
