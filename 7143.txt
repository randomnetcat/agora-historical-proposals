If there is no rule titled "Acidic Transactions", this proposal has no effect.

Change the power of the rule titled "Acidic Transactions" to 3. In
Rule 105, "Rule Changes", replace the sentence "Rule changes always
occur sequentially, never simultaneously." with "Every rule change is
a transaction."
