      Amend the section in rule 2148 now reading:

      "A foreign nomic may grant certain powers (in the
      ordinary-language sense) and privileges to Agora's ambassador. If
      so, the ambassador shall generally exercise such powers in such
      manner as e sees fit, subject to other rules and orders."

to read:

      "A foreign nomic may grant certain powers (in the
      ordinary-language sense) and privileges to Agora's ambassador. If
      so, the ambassador shall generally exercise such powers in such
      manner as e sees fit, subject to other rules and orders. If a
      foreign nomic allows for Agora to take actions in it, the
      ambassador may, with Agoran consent, take any action in it on
      behalf of Agora. However, no actions shall be taken on behalf of
      Agora in a nomic that is not Protected, Firendly or Neutral."
