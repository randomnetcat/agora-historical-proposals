[Not everyone has access to a server with both cron and mail-sending
capability.  This would allow for things like "At 23:59:59 UTC, if my
caste is Alpha, then I spend <notes> to reduce it" to be published at
any time during the last day of the month.

The prevention of e.g. "at 23;59:59.5" got lost during revision, but
has now been re-added.]

Amend Rule 478 (Fora) by replacing this text:

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by unambiguously
      and clearly specifying the action and announcing that e performs
      it.  Any action performed by sending a message is performed at
      the time date-stamped on that message.

      it, or that e will perform it at a specified time (an integral

      performed at the time date-stamped on that message, or at the
      specified future time (if any).
