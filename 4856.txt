Proposal:  Winning rearranged

[Cleans up the sillyness with 72 hours and "any particular moment" of
winning.  Makes repealing scoring instructions automatic on a win].

Amend Rule 2075 (Winning Hands) to read:

      The Scoring Instructions contained in cardbooks, interpreted
      collectively, may define a nonsite gambler as holding a winning
      hand.  Any Player may allege that a nonsite gambler holds a
      winning hand.  The allegation is considered true if any nonsite
      gambler holds a winning hand at the time of the allegation.

      If the allegation is true, the following events occur in order,
      immediately upon the allegation being made:

        (i) All nonsite gamblers holding winning hands are deemed to
            win the game simultaneously, and are awarded the defined
            regular Patent Title Champion, five white chips, and a
            blue chip (non-transferrable) marked with the number of
            red and white chips in the Pot.

       (ii) The pot is emptied.

      (iii) All Scoring Instructions in the Blueprints Cardbook are
            repealed.

       (iv) All Players' hands become subject to a Hand Reduction to
            the Minimum Hand Size.

      If the allegation is false, the Deckmastor shall, as soon as
      possible, discard 1 card at random from the hand of the Gambler
      who made the allegation.

      If no true allegation of a winning hand or a Skunk has been made
      in the last six months, then any Gambler may allege a Skunk,
      which, if true, triggers the effects of (iii) and (iv) above.
