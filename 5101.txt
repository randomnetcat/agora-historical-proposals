Amend rule 1551 to read

      Any player CAN ratify any purported publication of all or part
      of an official report, without objection.

      When a document is ratified, the gamestate is modified so that
      the ratified document was completely true and accurate at the
      time it was published.  Nevertheless, the ratification of a
      document does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel any
      messages or actions, even if they were unrecorded or overlooked,
      or change the legality of any attempted action.

      Where part of an official report has been the subject of a
      ratification, the date of the most recent such ratification is
      part of the same official report.

[Clarified based on the distinction between an official report (which
is a set of information) and a publication intended to reflect that
report.  Allow ratification of part of a report, to handle situations
where a single officer reports on more than one thing, or where
reporting obligations are switched between officers.  Allow anyone to
ratify, not just officer and Speaker, to help in cases where officer
identities (including the Speaker, as at present) are in doubt.]
