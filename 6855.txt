Amend Rule 2279 "Voting Limits on Ordinary Decisions" by replacing

       Take the Influence Level associated with the player's position
       on the list of succession, or 5 if the player is the Speaker.

with:

       Take the Influence Level associated with the player's position
       on the list of succession at the beginning of this week, or 5 if
       the player is the Speaker.

[It would be much easier to track then and it should avoid most timing
scams.]
