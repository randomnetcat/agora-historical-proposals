[Policy cards are broken.]

Create a Power-2 Rule titled "Sanitizing Proposals", reading:
      When a non-Sane Proposal in the Pool is Sanitized, it becomes
      Democratic and Sane.

      When a non-Sane Proposal whose Voting Period has begun but has
      not yet ended is Sanitized, it is Aborted as described
      elsewhere, and the copy resulting from the Abortion remains
      Distributable but becomes Democratic and Sane.

      A Proposal may only be Sanitized by the operation of an
      Instrument whose Power is at least 2.


Amend Rule 2021 by replacing the text reading:

      (b) An Untainted Speaker, with 2 Supporters, may Sanitize a
          Distributed Proposal that is not already Sane and for which
          the Voting Period has not ended. If the Speaker Sanitizes a
          Proposal, the Proposal is Aborted as described elsewhere;
          the Proposal remains Distributable, but becomes Democratic
          and Sane.

with:

      (b) An Untainted Speaker, with 2 Supporters, may Sanitize a
          Distributed Proposal that is not already Sane and for which
          the Voting Period has not ended.
