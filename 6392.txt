WHEREAS Agora has graced the world of Nomic with its presence for
nearly 16 years (1600 in Nomic years), and

WHEREAS such a long-running Nomic SHOULD leave behind medieval
trappings, and SHOULD adopt a more modern culture, and

WHEREAS Agora has a responsibility to the lesser Nomics to remove them
from the plagued darkness that now, even now, permeates the very cores
of their beings, and CAN only avail itself of this responsibility
through leadership, and CAN only lead by example, and

WHEREAS nobody even uses shields anymore,

Repeal Rule 2151 (Agoran Arms).
