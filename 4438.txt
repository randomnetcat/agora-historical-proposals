Proposal "The Wormhole"
----
Create a rule titled "The Wormhole" with text as follows.

The Wormhole is a bridge between two distinct Land Units in Arcadia, which
causes those Land Units to be adjacent. As soon as possible after the
fifteenth of each Agoran Month the Mapkeepor will determine the Land Units
that the Wormhole bridges as follows,

(1)   The first Land unit will always be (0,0)
(2)   The second Land Unit will be chosen at random but such that it is
distinct from (0,0) and all Land Units adjacent to (0,0)

The Mapkeepor will then report which Land Units the Wormhole bridges.
