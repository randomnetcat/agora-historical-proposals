Amend Rule 2040 by replacing the text reading:

      A player who may flip a switch on an entity to some state may do
      so by announcement.  In eir announcement, e must indicate the
      entity, switch, and new state.  When a switch on an entity is
      flipped to some state, the entity shall come to be in that state
      and simultaneously cease to be in any other state of the switch.

with:

      Whenever an instrument indicates that a switch on an entity is
      set or changed to some state, and the rules do not otherwise
      forbid it, the entity shall come to be in that state and
      simultaneously cease to be in any other state of the switch.

      A player who may flip a switch on an entity to some state other
      than the current state of the switch may do so by announcement.
      In eir announcement, e must indicate the entity, switch, and new
      state.  Upon this announcement, provided it is valid, the switch
      is set to the named state.


If the following text appears in Rule 2078:

      At the beginning of a Takeover Proposal's voting period, all
      players have their initiative flipped to Gote.  At the end of a
      Takeover Proposal's voting period, all players have their
      initiative flipped as follows:

then replace it with:

      At the beginning of a Takeover Proposal's voting period, the
      initiative of each player is set to Gote.  At the end of a
      Takeover Proposal's voting period, the initiative of each player
      is set as follows:


Otherwise, if the following text appears in Rule 2078:

      Mainsail is a stuck proposal switch, tracked by the Assessor,
      with values Tyrannical and Piratical.  When a Proposal's
      Mainsail is flipped to Piratical, it becomes democratic and
      sane.

      A Minimal Crew is defined as the number of active noisy
      players divided by 3.

      If a Proposal has a Piratical Mainsail at the end of its
      voting period, and at that time specifies a set of Players
      (the Raiders) in number neither less than a minimal crew nor
      greater than twice a minimal crew, then:
        (a) If the proposal is adopted, then all Raiders are
            flipped to Sente, and all other players are flipped to
            Gote.
        (b) Otherwise, all Raiders are flipped to Gote, and all
            other players are flipped to Sente.

then replace it with:

      Mainsail is a stuck proposal switch, tracked by the Assessor,
      with values Tyrannical and Piratical.  When a Proposal's
      Mainsail is set to Piratical, it becomes democratic and
      sane.

      A Minimal Crew is defined as the number of active noisy
      players divided by 3.

      If a Proposal has a Piratical Mainsail at the end of its
      voting period, and at that time specifies a set of Players
      (the Raiders) in number neither less than a minimal crew nor
      greater than twice a minimal crew, then:
        (a) If the proposal is adopted, then the Initiative of each
            Raider is set to Sente, and the Initiative of every
            other player is set to Gote.
        (b) Otherwise, the Initiative of each Raider is set to
            Gote, and the Initiative of every other player is set
            to Sente.


Amend Rule 1664 by replacing the text reading:

         - All Stock Cards in the possession of Abiding Players are
           returned to the Deck, and all Abiding Players have their
           initiative switched to Gote.

with:

         - All Stock Cards in the possession of Abiding Players are
           returned to the Deck, and the initiative of each Abiding
           Player is set to Gote.


Amend Rule 1871 by replacing the text reading:

      The CotC may switch the Orientation of players e expects to
      judge CFJs slowly or not at all to turned, without 2 objections.

with:

      The CotC may flip the Orientation of a player e expects to judge
      CFJs slowly or not at all to turned, without 2 objections.


Amend Rule 649 by replacing the text reading:

      Significance is a stuck switch for Patent Titles with states
      Historical, Hysterical, and Ephemeral.  The Herald may, Without
      Objection, cause a Title be switched from Historical
      Significance to Hysterical Significance.

with:

      Significance is a stuck switch for Patent Titles with states
      Historical, Hysterical, and Ephemeral.  The Herald may, Without
      Objection, flip a Title from Historical Significance to
      Hysterical Significance.


Amend Rule 2049 by replacing the text reading:

      A Patent Title has Ephemeral significance if the rules state
      that the Patent Title is ephemeral.  Karma is a stuck switch for
      ephemeral patent titles with states Boon and Albatross.
      Defining something to be a 'boon' or an 'albatross' is
      equivalent to defining it to be an ephemeral Patent Title with
      its Karma set as defined.

with:

      A Patent Title has Ephemeral significance if the rules state
      that the Patent Title is ephemeral.  Karma is a stuck switch for
      ephemeral patent titles with states Boon and Albatross.
      Defining something to be a 'boon' or an 'albatross' is
      equivalent to defining it to be an ephemeral Patent Title with
      its Karma set as defined, and the Karma of a title defined in
      this way is said to be Static.  A Static Karma switch may never
      be changed except by modifying its definition.  A Karma switch
      that is not Static is said to be Dynamic.


Amend rule 2051 by appending the text:

      (C) set each Dynamic Karma switch to its original state.
