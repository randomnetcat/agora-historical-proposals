Amend rule 1504 by inserting immediately before the item defining
"ALREADY TRIED" the new item

      * OVERLOOKED, appropriate if the alleged act allegedly occurred
        at least 200 days before the case was initiated

[Prevents dragging up misconduct years later, when it would be more
difficult to judge and likely unjust to punish.]
