Agree2Support

[It's hardly a burden to require panel members to state their
agreement to a decision for the record (deliberations can still
be private)].

Amend Rule 2157 by replacing:
      A judicial panel CAN send messages by means of any of its
      members sending a message identified as being from the panel,
      with the unanimous agreement of the panel's members, or (if the
      CotC is not a member) with the majority agreement of the members
      and the consent of the CotC.  The CotC SHOULD consent to a
      majority action if the panel has made a reasonable effort to
      achieve consensus.
