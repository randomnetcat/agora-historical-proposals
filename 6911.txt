Amend Rule 2309 (The Propose-O-matic) to read:

      The Fearmongor is an Office. Its holder is responsible for
      encouraging frequent rule changes.

      Each week, the Fearmongor SHALL do the following:

         1) Select a rule at random, and submit a proposal whose effect
            is limited to repealing that rule (and, if necessary,
            making a minimal set of other rule changes so that the game
            would not be broken by the repeal).  This proposal must be
            disinterested, with AI equal to the rule's power, and must
            note the rule's title.

         2) Select a rule (other than the one selected above) at
            random, and submit a proposal whose effect is limited to
            amending that rule in some fashion.  This proposal must be
            disinterested, with AI equal to the rule's power, and must
            note the rule's title.

          3) Submit a proposal whose effect is limited to enacting a
             rule identical to a rule that was once part of the ruleset
             and has not been used to fulfill this part of the duty
             within the past six months.  This proposal must be
             disinterested, with AI equal to 1.

          4) Make each of those proposals Distributable, clearly
            specifying that e is doing so to fulfill eir duties.

      Players SHALL NOT make proposals submitted in accordance with
      this rule Undistributable.
