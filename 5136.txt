Amend rule 2152 to read

      The following terms are defined for the discussion of the status
      of events.  The key words are spelled in all capitals.  Where
      these words are used in lowercase these definitions do not
      necessarily apply, but SHOULD be used as a guide to
      interpretation.

      Terms concerning the possibility of an event, or capacity of an
      entity to perform an action:

      * POSSIBLE, EFFECTIVE, VALID: the event is capable of occurring;
        attempts to perform the action are successful.

      * IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID: the event is not POSSIBLE;
        attempts to perform the action are unsuccessful.

      * EVITABLE: it is POSSIBLE for the event to not occur.

      * INEVITABLE: it is not POSSIBLE for the event to not occur.

      * <x> CAN <y>: it is POSSIBLE for <x> to <y>.

      * <x> CANNOT <y>: it is IMPOSSIBLE for <x> to <y>.

      Terms concerning obligations of an entity regarding performing
      an action:

      * MANDATORY, REQUIRED: there is an obligation to perform the
        action.

      * OPTIONAL: it is not MANDATORY to perform the action.

      * PROHIBITED, ILLEGAL: it is MANDATORY to not perform the
        action.

      * PERMITTED, LEGAL: it is not MANDATORY to not perform the
        action.

      * <x> MUST <y>, <x> SHALL <y>: it is MANDATORY for <x> to <y>.

      * <x> MUST NOT <y>, <x> SHALL NOT <y>, <x> MAY NOT <y>: it is
        PROHIBITED for <x> to <y>.

      * <x> MAY <y>: it is PERMITTED for <x> to <y>.

      Terms concerning the wisdom of performing an action:

      * RECOMMENDED, ENCOURAGED: it is specifically usually wise to
        perform the action.

      * UNRECOMMENDED, UNENCOURAGED: it is not RECOMMENDED to perform
        the action.

      * DEPRECATED, DISCOURAGED: it is RECOMMENDED to not perform the
        action.

      * UNDEPRECATED, UNDISCOURAGED: it is not RECOMMENDED to not
        perform the action.

      * <x> SHOULD <y>: it is RECOMMENDED for <x> to <y>.

      * <x> SHOULD NOT <y>: it is DEPRECATED for <x> to <y>.

      Possibility, requirement, and encouragement of an action are
      neither inherently related to each other, nor inherently related
      to the possibility, requirement, and encouragement
      (respectively) of the contrary action.  The terminology defined
      in this rule is used to govern each of these independently:
      anything said about one, using these terms, carries no
      implication regarding any of the others.

      For the purposes of the terminology defined by this rule,
      refraining from performing an action is itself an action, and
      the non-occurrence of an event is itself an event.

[Explicitly distinguishes terminology concerning the three different
aspects of an action, and makes clear that these are governed
separately.  All terms are now defined in antonymous pairs.]

Enact a power=2 rule with title "Grammar for Logic" and text

      The following terms are defined for the discussion of logical
      relationships between situations, events, and definitions.  The
      key words are spelled in all capitals.  Where these words are
      used in lowercase these definitions do not necessarily apply,
      but SHOULD be used as a guide to interpretation.

      * <x> IF <y>: if <y> is true then <x> is necessarily the case;
        says nothing about situations where <y> is false.

      * <x> ONLY IF <y>: <not-x> IF <not-y>.

      * <x> IFF <y>: <x> IF <y> and <x> ONLY IF <y>.

      * <x> UNLESS <y>: <x> IF <not-y>.

      * IF <x> THEN <y>: <y> IF <x>.

[Explicitly define these terms to have their usual propositional logic
meaning.  The original MMI attempts to define "ONLY IF", but in a
restricted context, and isn't totally clear.]
