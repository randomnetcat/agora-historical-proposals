Amend Rule 2320 by replacing the last paragraph with the following:

      When an entity (the debtor) incurs a debt for something to
      another entity (the creditor), e SHALL transfer it to that
      entity as soon as possible; failure to do so is the Class-N
      Crime of Defaulting, where N is 3 if the debt has not been
      forgiven and 0 if it has.  The creditor of a debt CAN forgive it
      by announcement.

[Currently, it's unclear what happens if the debt is forgiven after
the time limit has already passed.]
