Amend rule 478 (Fora) by appending the following:
{{
   Alternately, an action that CAN be performed "by announcement" can
   instead be performed by the performance of another action (including
   causing another entity to act) which is clearly and unambiguously
   defined in and allowed by a Rule or public contract to cause the
   first action to be performed. In the case of a public contract
   defining the second action, the entity that performs the first
   action must either be a member of the contract, or the contract
   itself.
}}

Amend rule 1742 (Contracts) by appending the following to the first paragraph:
{{
   A contract has a number of persons who are party to that contract
and bound to it, as defined by other rules. Non-persons cannot be
party to a contract.
}}

[Note: This allows non-person contracts to act where allowed by their
own text. I don't think this is gamebreaking at all, since the number
of such actions that are possible are limited.]
