Create a new rule, titled "Team Captains" of Power = 1, with the following
text:

Leadership is a loose Team switch with values null and each of the Team's
Members.  The Scorekeepor shall maintain and report records for this switch.

If a Team's leadership is null, any Member of that Team may flip the Team's
leadership, Without Objection from the other Members of that Team.

If a Team's leadership is non-null, the leadership identifies the Team Captain,
who is the Executor of that Team.  The Captain may flip eir Team's leadership
without restriction; any other Member of the Team may flip the Team's
leadership with N Supporters, where N + 1 is the minimal majority of that
Team's Members.

If the Team Captain ceases to be a member of the Team, that Team's leadership
becomes null.
