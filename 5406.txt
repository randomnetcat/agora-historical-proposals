Create a rule title "Power of Attorney", Power 2, with the following text:
A Power of Attorney is a kind of public contract with two parties, referred to
as the Granter and the Grantee.
The Granter of a Power of Attorney is in no way restricted from acting on eir
own behalf. The Grantee may only act on behalf of the Granter as permitted by
the contract, and only as allowed by the rules.
A Power of Attorney may be disbanded by any player with 2 support. When a
Power of Attorney is disbanded in this faction, then, without objection, the
Granter is deregistered.

Amend rule 1504 by adding, after "The CotC's report includes the status of all
active sentences.", the following:
If a Grantee of a Power of Attorney caused the Granter to breach a rule, then
the sentence shall be applied to the Grantee rather than the Granter, if the
Grantee is a player.
