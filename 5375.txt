Amend Rule 2144 (Limited Partnerships) to read:

      A partnership SHALL NOT register if its basis is the same as
      that of any player.  Whenever a judgement of GUILTY is assigned
      in a criminal case alleging that a partnership has violated this
      rule, the judge SHOULD assign an EXILE judgement to the question
      on sentencing in that case.

      If a registered partnership has the same basis as another
      player, any player CAN deregister it with Agoran Consent.
