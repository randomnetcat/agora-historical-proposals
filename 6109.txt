Amend the following paragraph in Rule 2019:

     e) Wielder of Extra Votes.  The Wielder of Extra Votes at the
        start of an ordinary proposal's voting period has a voting
        limit on that proposal of 1.4 times what it would be
        otherwise (rounded to the nearest integer, breaking ties
        toward odd integers), rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

by replacing "1.4" with "1.5" and "odd" with "even".

[Surely I deserve  _one_ extra vote.]
