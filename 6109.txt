Amend Rule 101 by appending the following to the list of rights:

     viii. Every player has the right to some formal influence over
           the result of the decision-making process regarding
           whether to adopt a proposal (e.g. having at least one
           vote).

[It is, of course, still possible for one person's such influence to
be drastically less than another's.]
