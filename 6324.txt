[It seems to me that a lot of voters read a proposal, decide whether
they like the intent of it, and vote based on that, without
remembering potentially important criticisms (or praise!) levied by
other players when it was proposed.  As it can take up to a week for a
proposal to be distributed, this isn't surprising.]

Create a new Rule titled "Just my Opinion", reading:

      Each player has an opinion on each proposal, which is a body of
      text no more than 100 words long, empty by default.  Any player
      CAN set eir opinion on a proposal by announcement; to clear an
      opinion is to set it to the empty string.  Players SHOULD keep
      their opinions reasonably minimal in order to avoid cluttering
      distributions.  When a person distributes a proposal, e SHALL
      include with its text all nonempty opinions on it.
