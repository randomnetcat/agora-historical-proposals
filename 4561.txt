Amend Rule 1960 (Roles) by replacing the text that reads:

      Role is a stuck player switch with values null, politician,
      scribe, and acolyte.

with the text:

      Role is a stuck player switch with values null, Acolyte, Patron,
      Politician, and Scribe.


Amend Rule 2011 (Role-Based Powers) by retitling it "Progressive Actions"
and making it read:

      An action is a Progressive action if the rules so state.

      If an action is progressive, a Player (the Actor) may perform
      the action either:

      (a) with the Support of a number Players equal to one plus the
          number of times that Actor has performed that action in the
          current week;
      (b) by paying a fee equal to the amount of Support required in
          (a);
      (c) if the number calculated in (a) is zero, by public
          announcement.

      A progressive action may be associated with a role if the rules
      so state.  If an progressive action is associated with a role,
      only players who hold that role may perform, or support
      performance of, that action.


Create a new rule entitled "Role-Based Powers", which reads:

      For Acolytes, Absolving an entity is a progressive action.
      Absolving an entity expunges 1 Blot from that entity.

      For Patrons, Donating to a Team is a progressive Action.  The
      effect of Donating to a Team is to increase that Team's Team
      Points by 5.

      For Politicians, Debating an Undistributed Proposal is a 
      progressive Action.  The effect of Debating a Proposal is to 
      change its Chamber to one named by the Politician, provided it 
      is legal for that Proposal to be in the named Chamber and the 
      Proposal is not Sane.

      For Scribes, Rubberstamping a Proposal is a progressive action.
      A Rubberstamped Proposal becomes Distributable.
