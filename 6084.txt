Repeal Rule 2238.

 [Yes, I realize you could just leapfrog the clause to another
 power-1 rule, and I could re-propose with something along the
 lines of "repeal any changes made by instruments empowered by
 the announcement clause or empowered by instruments empowered
 by the announcement..." but hopefully you're willing to avoid
 the mess :)]

 Amend Rule 1922 by appending:

   (h) Missed Congeniality, to be awarded to persons who
       gain the ability to make arbitrary changes to Rules
       with a power less than 2 by announcement, but lose
       the ability before gaining the ability to make such
       changes to higher-powered rules.

[Proof of the pudding]:
 comex and ais523 are hereby each awarded Missed Congeniality,
 unless, at some point in the past month, a power 2+ rule
 contained the exact phrase "comex and ais523 were here".
