[ Allows the judge to specify any number of Rest less than 15 when
judging SILENCE, and when the judgement remains in effect for a
continuous week, any player can create the rests in the possession of
the ninny. I've kept Class-N Crimes in though, as there may still be
cases in which the defendant admits guilt and creates the Rests
straight-away. ]

Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing

      * SILENCE, a number of Rests, equal to the defined Class of the
        Crime or (if the breach is not a defined crime) the power of
        the breached Rule, rounded to the nearest integer with ties
        broken by rounding up, are created in the possession of the
        Ninny.  The judge CAN, with 2 Support, set the fine at a
        different integral level between one half and double that
        amount, and SHOULD attempt to do so if necessary to ensure
        that the correlation between the fine and the severity of the
        breach is appropriate, or to account for the faith (good or
        bad) shown by the Ninny in contesting the notice or in aiding
        or obstructing the course of justice.

with:

      * SILENCE with a positive number less than 15 (X). If a
        judgement of SILENCE has been in effect continuously for one
        week (or longer), any player CAN create a number of Rests
        equal to X in the possession of the ninny, by announcement.
