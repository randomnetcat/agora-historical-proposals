[Right now, rebellion is almost a no-brainer for those on top
of the stack.  At the cost of 1 rest, ensure holding your
position that cost lots to get to?  Done.  This is opposite
my original intent, which was to encourage rebellion in those
lower in the list.  This proposal makes it much more expensive
for the top people to rebel and fail].

Amend Rule 2270 (Coups D'etat) by replacing:
         (i) If the rebellion fails, one Rest is created in the
             possession of every Rebel, and one additional Rest is
             created in the possession of the coup initiator, and a
             Leadership Token is created in the possession of the
             Speaker.
with:
         (i) If the rebellion fails, one Rest is created in the
             possession of every Rebel, and one additional Rest is
             created in the possession of the coup initiator, and a
             Leadership Token is created in the possession of the
             Speaker.  Then, beginning with the rebel lowest in
             the list and moving upward, each rebel on the list
             is moved one position lower on the list.

and by appending the following paragraph:

          The Herald SHALL publish the resulting List of
          Succession in the same message in which e resolves
          the coup.

[Wooble does this anyway, but it's a good practice to mandate].
