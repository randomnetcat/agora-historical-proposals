Amend Rule 879 (Quorum) to read:

      Quorum for an Agoran decision is 5, unless

        a) this is larger than the number of eligible voters with a
           positive voting limit on that decision, in which case
           quorum is that number; or

        b) the decision is whether to approve a dependent action, in
           which case quorum is zero.
