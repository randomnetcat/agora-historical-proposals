[If you want to replace someone in office before 90 days are up, you
need more support to try - you can still do it if you have a lot of
support, e.g. to impeach a truly bad officer.  Added vacancies as
per Yally's suggestion].

 Amend R2154 (Election Procedure) by replacing:

      Any player CAN, with Support, initiate an election for a
      specified elected office for which no election is already in
      progress.

 with:

      Any player CAN, by announcement, initiate an election for a
      specified elected office that is vacant, or for which no
      election has been initiated in the preceding 90 days.  Any
      player CAN, with 4 Supporters, initiate an election for a
      specified elected office for which no election is already in
      progress.
