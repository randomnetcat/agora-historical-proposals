Amend Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) by replacing the text:

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
      from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
      its adoption index, and then it takes effect.  It does not
      otherwise take effect.  This rule takes precedence over any rule
      which would permit a proposal to take effect.

with:

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
      from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
      its adoption index, and then it takes effect.  It does not
      otherwise take effect.

      Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change.
      This rule takes precedence over any rule which would permit a
      proposal to take effect.
