     If a notice remains uncontested for four days, a number of Rests
     are created in the possession of the Accused equal to the power
     of the violated Rule rounded up.

with the text:

     A Notice that is still Uncontested four days after it is published
     automatically becomes Closed instead. Any player CAN cause a Notice
     specifying em as Accused to become Closed by announcement. When a
     Notice becomes Closed, a number of Rests are created in the
     possession of the Accused equal to the power of the violated Rule,
     rounded up.
