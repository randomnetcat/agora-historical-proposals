[This proposal should clean up the Ribbon rule for the last time. The
first bit is redundant. The second bit was always intended, I think.]
Amend Rule 2199 by removing
       When a player earns a Ribbon as outlined below, any person CAN
       once, in a timely manner (except for White Ribbons, which can be
       awarded at any time within a month after they are earned),
       create that Ribbon in the player's possession by announcement,
       unless the player already possesses the color of Ribbon e earned
       (earning a Ribbon more than once entitles the bearer to multiple
       Ribbon awards, though capitalizing on this may be difficult):
and by adding
       A Ribbon may only be of a color mentioned in this rule; if a
       Ribbon somehow has any other color, it is destroyed.
after
       Each Ribbon has exactly one color.  Colors with different names
       are distinct, regardless of spectral proximity.  Each color of
       Ribbon is a currency.
