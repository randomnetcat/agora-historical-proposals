Amend Rule 101 (The Rights of Agorans) by replacing:
      BE IT HEREBY PROCLAIMED that no interpretation of Agoran law or
      binding agreement may substantially limit or remove a person's
      rights as defined by this Rule, except through the explicit and
      legal amendment of this Rule.  This rule takes precedence over
      any rule which would allow or mandate restrictions of the rights
      contained herein.
with:
      BE IT HEREBY PROCLAIMED that no interpretation of Agoran law or
      binding agreement may substantially limit or remove a person's
      rights as defined by this Rule, except through the explicit and
      legal amendment of this Rule.  For the purposes of this Rule,
      a "person" is defined strictly as any unique biological organism
      that is generally capable of initiating the communication of
      independent thought, and a "player" is any such organism that
      is also a player of Agora.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule which would allow or
      mandate restrictions of the rights contained herein.

[It's often bothered me that R101 could be gotten around by redefining
"person" (for example via R2150).  This creates an independent
definition (though nearly identical to the first-class person
definition) so R101 is self-contained and any rights-changes for
real persons must occur through R101.  At the same time, this gets
rid of rights in general for rules-defined persons - they shouldn't
have them - down with corporate rights!].
