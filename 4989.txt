Amend rule 869 by appending the paragraph:

      A player who is not a person and has never been a natural person
      can be deregistered by any player by announcement.

[We are faced with some players that used to be non-natural legal
persons and are no longer persons.  Such entities can't actually act
as players.  This would allow them to be removed from playerhood in
these circumstances.  The "never been a natural person" provision
is paranoia, to prevent a problem with the definition of personhood
triggering deregistration of humans.]
