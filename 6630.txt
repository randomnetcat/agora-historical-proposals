Remove the following text from Rule 2284 (Fee-based actions):

    - A player CAN veto or rubberstamp an ongoing ordinary decision
       for a charge of 3 ergs.

[This gives the powers of veto and rubberstamp solely to the holders
of those cards, thus removing the boring ability for everyone to simply
be able to rubberstamp/veto.]
