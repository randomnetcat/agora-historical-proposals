In Rule 2152 change:

     4. CAN X ONLY IF Y:  Equivalent to "CANNOT X unless Y".  Similar
        for (MUST, MAY, SHALL, SHOULD) X ONLY IF Y.

to:

     4. CAN X ONLY IF Y:  Equivalent to "CANNOT X UNLESS Y".  Similar
        for (MUST, MAY, SHALL, SHOULD) X ONLY IF Y.

[[[ This is consistent with capatilizing ONLY IF. ]]]
