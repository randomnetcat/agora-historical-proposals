Amend Rule 2242 by replacing this text:

      Upon a win announcement that a specified non-contest player owns
      a Medal, that player satisfies the Winning Condition of
      Championship.

with this text:

      Upon a win announcement by a non-contest player that e owns a
      Medal, that player satisfies the Winning Condition of
      Championship.

[Win by High Score allows anybody to announce the win because it
causes a score reset, and it's desirable to go ahead and get that over
with as soon as possible.  For win by Championship, there's no reason
to allow others to force the timing of the win.]
