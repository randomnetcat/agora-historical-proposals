Proposal
End Tax Avoidance

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

Amend Rule 1598 by replacing the text in it which currently reads:


	(f) If the transferor transfers Property to the transferee with 	    the 
purpose of satisfying a debt, or of paying the Fee 	    associated with 
performing an action, but the debt does not 	    exist, or the action is not 
successfully performed, then 	    the transferor may publicly demand the 
return of the 		    Property. The effect of such a demand is to cause the 	  
   transferee to incur a debt to the transferor for the 	    Property 
transferred.

with text which reads:

	(f) If the transferor transfers Property to the transferee with 	    the 
purpose of satisfying a debt, or of paying the Fee 	    associated with 
performing an action, but the debt does not 	    exist, or the action is not 
successfully performed, then 	    the transferee incurs a debt to the 
transferor for that 	    Property.

[comment: this is for you, Goethe.]

When this Proposal takes effect, all rights that entities have to demand the 
return of Property under the provisions of Rule 1598/12(f) are forfeited; in 
compensation, where such a right existed at the time this Proposal takes 
effect, the transferee of whom the demand could have been made incurs a debt 
to the transferor for Property equivalent to that the return of which the 
transferor had the right to demand.

[In other words, the Bank incurs a debt of 75 Stems to Goethe.]
