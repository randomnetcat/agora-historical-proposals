Create a power-1.7 rule with the following text:
{{{
At the start of each month, one Rest is created in the possession of
each active player.
}}}
[The idea is that players who have done anything useful can trivially
burn off the Rests with the Notes they got for it; even players who are
just here to participate in contests will get Notes for earning points
in them. It's only the players who do nothing who'll be hurt by this.]
