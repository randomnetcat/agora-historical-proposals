[Past incarnations of the veto never really produced any interesting
gameplay, because nobody used it; maybe making it a true veto will
help.

This defines a new outcome so that the author neither gains nor loses
any points on a vetoed proposal.]

If Rule 1950 does not mention Ordinary decisions, this proposal has no effect.

Create a new Power-3 rule titled "Veto":

      The President CAN veto a specified Ordinary decision by
      announcement.  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
      outcome of an decision that has been vetoed is VETOED.
