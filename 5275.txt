Amend Rule 1551 (Ratification) to read:

      A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.

      An official document is a public document purported to be part
      (possibly all) of an official report; this part is the document's
      scope.  Any player CAN, without objection, ratify an official
      document, specifying its scope.  The date of this ratification
      and the scope of the ratified document become part of the
      official report in question, until the same scope is ratified at
      a later date.

      Any public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
      ratified one week after its publication, unless explicitly
      challenged during that period.

      When a public document is ratified, the gamestate is modified so
      that the ratified document was completely true and accurate at the
      time it was published.  Nevertheless, the ratification of a public
      document does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel any
      messages or actions, even if they were unrecorded or overlooked,
      or change the legality of any attempted action.

Amend Rule 2034 (Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges) to read:

      Any proposal that would otherwise change the validity of any
      existing vote on any specific unresolved Agoran decision is wholly
      without effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.  This does
      not prevent amendment of the rules governing the validity of votes
      on Agoran decisions in general.

      Once an Agoran decision has been resolved, votes on it CANNOT be
      validly submitted or retracted, and its outcome CANNOT be changed
      in any way, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.  This does not
      prevent correcting errors in reporting its resolution.

      A public document purporting to resolve an Agoran decision is
      self-ratifying.
