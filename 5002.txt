Amend rule 879 to read:

      The quorum for an Agoran decision is NEV^0.55, rounded up, where
      NEV is the number of eligible voters with a positive voting
      limit on that decision.

[Smoothly varying quorum proportion, no need for multiple formulae.  A
power law roughly matches the way attendance levels tend to go in
committees.]
