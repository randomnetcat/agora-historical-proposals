Create a rule titled "Agoran Welcoming Committee" with this text:

     The Greeter is an imposed office.

     While a partnership named "Welcoming Committee" exists, and its
     obligations include all of the following:

       a) Greet all new players.
       b) Engage in contact with new players to assist them.
       c) Engage in contact with new players to ensure a positive
          experience.

     then this office is imposed upon that partnership.  Otherwise,
     this office is vacant.
