Chamber fix

proposal:  Chamber fix

[Changes in v1.0: Put in Maud's wording, added Speaker ability to
 unstall with support.  In terms of crime, I don't generally like to
 add them for things that we can undo (e.g., "that's against the
 rules, so it didn't happen").  For good reasons, distributing a
 stalled proposal still happens, so that's a case where it's worth
 having something to prevent the Promoter from distributing something
 against the rules just cause e can.]

Amend Rule 1933 to read:

      Chamber is a stuck proposal switch with values ordinary and
      democratic.

      An ordinary proposal with an adoption index of two or greater is
      stalled.  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a stalled
      proposal is undistributable, and if a proposal is distributed
      that was stalled at the time of distribution, its chamber shall
      immediately and automatically be set to democratic.  If the
      Promotor knowingly distributes a stalled proposal, e commits the
      class 4 crime of Improper Debate.

      Any player can flip the Chamber of a stalled proposal to
      democratic without objection.  The Speaker can flip the Chamber
      of a stalled proposal to democratic with support.
