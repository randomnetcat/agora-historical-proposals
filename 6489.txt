Amend Rule 2161 (ID Numbers) by replacing this text:

      (c) Each ID number is either orderly (default) or chaotic.  Upon
          a judicial finding that the assignment of an ID number was
          ILLEGAL, the ID number becomes chaotic.

with this text:

      (c) Each ID number is either orderly (default) or chaotic.  Upon
          a judicial finding that an ID number is unreasonably large,
          the ID number becomes chaotic.

[What constitutes "unreasonably large" is left to judicial discretion.]
