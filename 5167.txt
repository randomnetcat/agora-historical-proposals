Amend rule 2126 by replacing, in the list of ways that VCs can be
gained (and lost, if both are in a single list), the item that
describes gaining blue VCs with

      (+B) When a player assigns a judgement to a judicial question
           other than a question on sentencing, and has not violated a
           requirement to submit that judgement within a time limit, e
           gains one blue VC.

and then inserting in the list of ways that VCs can be gained (and
lost, if both are in a single list), immediately after the last item
that mentions blue VCs, the new item

      (+K) When a player assigns a judgement to a judicial question on
           sentencing, and has not violated a requirement to submit
           that judgement within a time limit, e gains one black VC.

and then inserting in the list of ways that VCs can be lost (and
gained, if both are in a single list), immediately after the last item
that mentions either blue VCs or black VCs, the new item

      (-K) In a criminal case, when a sentence becomes active for the
           first time the defendant loses one black VC.

[A color that's more difficult to get.  Random trivia: the traditional
black cap worn by judges passing a death sentence is still part of a
judge's official regalia in the UK, despite the death penalty having
been abolished four decades ago; it is now worn only on ceremonial
occasions.  The black VC loss here is deliberately not the direct
complement of the way to gain a black VC, but occurs in a closely
related situation.  Losing a VC is an extra, fairly small, penalty in
serious criminal cases; the interesting bit is that the threat of
losing a rare color, rather than one's party color, should make black
VC holders paranoid about being accused of rule violations.]
