Enact a rule, titled "Ordinary Chamber", with power 2:
{
      VVLOP is a player switch, tracked by the Assessor, whose
      possible values are the non-negative integers, and whose default
      value is four for first-class players and zero for second-class
      players.  The voting limit of an entity on an Ordinary Decision
      is eir VVLOP.

      Voting Credits (or VCs) are a fixed currency whose recordkeepor
      is the Promotor. Whenever a proposal is adopted, its author
      gains a number of VCs equal to the integer part of the
      proposal's adoption index, and each of the proposal's co-authors
      who is a first-class player gains one VC.

      A person may spend two VCs to increase any player's VVLOP by
      one. A first-class person may spend one VC to increase any other
      first-class player's VVLOP by one. A person may spend two VCs to
      decrease any other player's VVLOP by one.

      Whenever a person's VVLOP becomes 12 or greater, or the total
      VVLOP of all second-class players is greater than the total
      VVLOP of all first-class players, all VVLOPs are set to their
      default values, and all VCs are destroyed.
