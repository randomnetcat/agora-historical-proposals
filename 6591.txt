Title: power => mutability
Author: G.
Co-authors: 
Adoption index: 3.9

Increase the power of Rule 2140 (Power Controls Mutability) to 3.9
Increase the power of Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) to 3.9

[Note: not all the text in R106 has to be high-powered, only the
last two paragraphs.  Split/refactor of 106 into proposal definition
and submission versus proposal adoption useful?]

[Difference between 3.9 and 4.0 is trivial in terms of votes and
reserved for emergencies in terms of precedence].
