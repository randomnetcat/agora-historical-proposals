If Rule 2050 (The Garden) exists, amend it by removing this text:

      If there are no Players that hold at least one Weed or Daffodil,
      the Herald may repeal this Rule without Objection.

If Rule 2050 (The Garden) does not exist, create a Rule titled
"The Garden" with Power=2 and this text:

      A Daffodil is a Boon that may be awarded as the Rules specify or
      by an Instrument of Power 2 or greater.

      A Weed is an Albatross that may be awarded as the Rules specify
      or by an Instrument of Power 2 or greater.
