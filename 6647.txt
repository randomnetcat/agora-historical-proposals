Create a rule titled "Props" with this text:

    Props are a currency.

    The Air Traffic Controller is an office and the recordkeepor
    of props.

    Ownership of props is limited to first-class players.  Props
    CANNOT be created, transferred, or destroyed except as allowed
    by this rule or required by the rules in general.

    When a first-class player registers, 14 props are created in
    eir possession.  When a first-class player deregisters, eir
    props are destroyed.

    Once per week, each player CAN transfer a prop from one player
    to another, provided that e explains why e chose each player,
    and does not transfer it to emself.

    Players with at least 23 props are Pilots; the Pilot with the
    most props (if any) is the Captain. Players with less than
    5 props are Marines.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, install Murphy as Air Traffic
Controller.
