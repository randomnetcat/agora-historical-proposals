Adoption index: 3.0

[I still don't think this is a change, only a clarification, and fully
in the spirit of the original rule.  However, if a good proposal to
strengthen this right is submitted, I might vote FOR.]

Amend Rule 101 by replacing:
     Every player has the right to deregister rather than continue to
     play.
with:
     Every player has the right to deregister; e may continue to
     accrue obligations and penalties after deregistration but, if e
     wishes to ignore the game, such penalties shall not unduly
     harass em.
