In Rule 2367 "Messy Statements", replace "nonsensical and meaningless"
with "inaccurate and incorrect".

[Revert P7395, because it probably breaks Win by Paradox.  The intent
of the rule was to prevent trivial paradoxes based on violating rules
requiring statements to be accurate, but just about any CFJ statement
about a legitimate paradox based on infinite regress - I have one in
mind - is messy, so is now "nonsensical and meaningless": although
UNDECIDABLE is still appropriate, such a CFJ would probably no longer
count as a turtle because the meaningless statement would not be about
"the possibility or legality of a rule-defined action".]
