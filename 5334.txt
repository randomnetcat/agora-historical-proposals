Amend Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) by replacing this text:

      A player submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
      indication that it is intended to become a proposal, which
      places the proposal in the Proposal Pool.  The proposer of a
      proposal may remove it from the Pool by announcement.

with this text:

      A player submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
      indication that it is intended to become a proposal, which
      places the proposal in the Proposal Pool.  That player is
      its author (syn. proposer).  The author of a proposal may
      remove it from the Pool by announcement.

      A person is a co-author of a proposal if and only if e is
      distinct from its author, and unambiguously identified by
      its author as being its co-author at the time of submission.

Amend Rule 1681 (The Logical Rulesets) by replacing this text:

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor shall
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating the type
      of change, the date on which the change took effect, the
      mechanism which specified the change, and if the rule was
      changed due to a proposal, a reference to that proposal, its
      proposer, and any coauthors explicitly named in that proposal.

with this text:

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor shall
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating:

        a) The type of change.

        b) The date on which the change took effect.

        c) The mechanism that specified the change.

        d) If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that
           proposal's ID number, author, and co-author(s) (if any).

Amend Rule 2126 (Voting Credits) by replacing "each coauthor named
in the proposal" with "each coauthor of the proposal".
