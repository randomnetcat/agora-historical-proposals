Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing the text:
      * OVERLOOKED, appropriate if the alleged act allegedly occurred
        at least 200 days before the case was initiated
with:
      * OVERLOOKED, appropriate if the alleged act did not occur
        within one month before the case was initiated, although the
        initiator of the case could have reasonably initiated it
        within that period

[In most cases, CFJ 1935 would have been an improper CFJ because it
was called substantially after the fact, and OVERLOOKED should have
been appropriate.  In this case, admittedly, the delay was only due to
a similar equity case the judgement of which I rejected, so it
wouldn't be.]
