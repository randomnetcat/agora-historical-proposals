In rule 2316:

[The current rule does not provide any clear way to replace the pope,
and suggests that the only player who can legally become a pope is the
pope. This does not make sense.]

Amend the phrase "and the specified player is indeed a pope" in the
third paragraph to read "and the specified player is indeed a
cardinal".

Replace every instance of the phrase "the pope" in the fourth
paragraph with the phrase "the previous pope".
