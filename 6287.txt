Ratify the document purporting to be the SLR published most recently
before this proposal was submitted.

[It's possible that many rule changes failed, unknown to us, due to
the last paragraph of R1482, and ratifying them in the past failed due
to precedence.  This should be adopted after 'Precedence fixes'.]
