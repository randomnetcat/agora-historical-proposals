Enact a Rule with the following text:

      Bombs are a class of assets; their ownership is restricted to
      active players. The Secretary of State for Defence is an office
      and recordkeepor of bombs.

      If e has not already done so in the current week, a player CAN
      create a bomb in eir possession for a cost of 50 Yaks. The
      player who created a bomb is its engineer.

      If a player (the snail) has possessed a particular bomb
      continuously for 24 hours, then that bomb explodes. When a bomb
      explodes, it is destroyed and 100 of the snail's Yaks are
      transferred to the bomb's engineer, except if the snail is the
      engineeer, in which case the Yaks are destroyed.

      If a player (the idiot) transfers a bomb to another player who
      has already possessed the same bomb in the current week then the
      bomb is immediately transferred back to the idiot and then
      explodes.

      Within 48 hours after each bomb explodes the Secretary of State
      for Defence SHALL make a public statement to inform the Yak
      Herdor of the explosion and any changes in Yak holdings which
      occurred as a result.
