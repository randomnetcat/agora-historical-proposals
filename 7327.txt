In Rule 1504, "Criminal Cases", add the following item to the list of
valid sentences, immediately before TIME OUT:

        DEPOSITION with an elected office and a number of days between
        0 and 90, inclusive, appropriate if the rule breach amounted
        to a failure to appropriately carry out the duties of that
        office, and the specified number of days is reasonably
        correlated with the severity of the rule breach. When in
        effect, the ninny is removed from the office; and, rules to
        the contrary notwithstanding, the ninny CANNOT hold the office
        or accept a nomination for the office for the specified number
        of days after the sentence first went into effect.
