Amend Rule 2258 (Decks, Draws, and Salaries) to read:
      Any deck of cards defined by this rule is known as a Basic Deck.
      Each first-class player has four fungible Salary switches tracked
      by the Accountor. The possible values of a Salary switch are the
      defined basic decks.

      The default value of a Salary switch is Change if its owner has at
      most one other Salary switch set to Change, or otherwise Justice
      if its owner has no other Salary switch set to Justice, or
      otherwise Government.

      A player CAN change the value of any of eir own Salary switches by
      announcement.

      At the beginning of each month, each first-class player earns a
      number of draws from each Basic Deck equal to the number of
      eir Salary switches that were flipped to that deck at the
      beginning of the month.  As soon as possible after the beginning
      of each month, the Accountor SHALL publish the state of each
      first-class player's Salary switches as they were at the beginning
      of the month.

      Office Salary is a switch for each office tracked by the
      Accountor, with possible values being the names of each basic
      deck (default Government).  The holder of each OFFICE CAN change
      that office's salary by announcement.  At the beginning of each
      week, each holder of an office earns a number of draws from the
      deck indicated by the switch equal to the interest index for
      that office.

      When a first-class player registers, e earns two draws from each
      basic deck.

      The Deck of Government is a deck of cards tracked by the Grand
      Poobah.

      The Deck of Justice is a deck of cards tracked by the Insulator.

      The Deck of Change is a deck of cards tracked by the Anarchist.
