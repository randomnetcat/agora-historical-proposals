Title: Loose ordering of ID numbers

Adoption index: 2.0

Amend Rule 2161 (ID Numbers) by replacing this text:

     greater than any orderly ID number,

with this text:

     greater than any orderly ID number (unless the type of entity
     is defined as loosely ordered),

Amend Rule 991 (Judicial Cases Generally) by appending this text to
the last paragraph:

     Judicial cases are loosely ordered.

[Due to the heterogeneous nature of judicial cases and the processing
thereof, there are three orders - initiation (chronological), entry
into the database (determines ID numbers in practice), and publication
(legally determines ID numbers) - none of which are the same.]

[Could also be applied to proposals, but proposals are homogeneous
so there is no practical need.  Cannot be applied to rules, where
order affects precedence.]

Upon the adoption of this proposal, each judicial case lacking an ID
number, and initiated after the creation of Rule 2161 (ID Numbers) but
before the distribution of this proposal, is assigned the ID number
(if any) informally assigned to it by the CotC database
(http://zenith.homelinux.net/cotc/).

[A technicality.  No other aspects of the judicial process explicitly
depend on ID numbers, and references to legally-ineffective ID numbers
are still effective to the extent that intent was unambiguous.]
