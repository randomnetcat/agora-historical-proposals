Amend Rule 2226 (Judicial Rank) by replacing this text:

      When a judgement is overruled on appeal, if the prior judge's
      rank is higher than 0, then it is decreased by 1, and e CANNOT
      increase it for 30 days afterward (the rest of this rule
      notwithstanding), unless eir new rank is 0, in which case e CAN
      increase it to 1 at any time by spending 3 Notes.

      "District", "Circuit", and "Supreme" are synonymous with
      judicial ranks 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

with this text:

      When a judgement is overruled on appeal, if the prior judge's
      rank is higher than 0, then it is decreased by 1, and e CANNOT
      increase it by announcement for 30 days afterward (the rest of
      this rule notwithstanding).

      "Supreme", "Circuit", "District", and "Night" are synonymous
      with judicial ranks 3, 2, 1, and 0, respectively.

[Apart from confusing nested exceptions, the "3 Notes" clause was
also broken because Notes were repealed.  If/when a comparable Card
mechanism is created, it will work because it's not by announcement.]
