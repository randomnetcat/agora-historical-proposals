Replace the text of R1688 with the following:
       The Power of an entity is a non-negative rational number.
       An Instrument is an entity with positive Power.

       The Power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
       stipulated by the Rules.  All entities have Power zero except
       where specifically allowed by the rules.

       A Rule that secures a change, action, or value (hereafter the
       securing Rule) thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that change
       or action, or to modify that value, except as allowed by an
       Instrument with Power greater than or equal to the change's Power
       Threshold.  This Threshold defaults to the securing Rule's Power,
       but CAN be lowered as allowed by that Rule (including by the Rule
       itself).
