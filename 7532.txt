Title: Alternative: just ban last-minute actions in the first place

Amend Rule 478 (Fora) by removing:

      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at the
      time date-stamped on that message.

and, if present, by removing all text starting with "The timing of an
action performed by sending a message"; and by appending:

      Any action performed by sending a message is performed at its
      true time.  If it would otherwise be ambiguous whether an action
      is performed before or after a deadline, then it is considered
      to be performed after.  A person SHALL NOT attempt to perform an
      action whose effect substantially changes after a Rules-defined
      deadline by sending a message to a forum in the ten minutes
      before the deadline, unless the effect of the message would
      extend the deadline.

      The true time of a message sent via a forum is the time when the
      forum started to make it available to other players.  The true
      time of a message sent manually to all players is the time when
      the last copy was sent.  If a message is sent independently via
      multiple means, then its true time is instead the earliest of
      the true times of each such instance.

[Thus you're trying to send a message - not have it received, but send
it - as close to ten minutes before the deadline, rather than the
deadline itself, as possible.  This keeps the actual validity of such
messages hopefully unambiguous, and theoretically does not give anyone
the chance to legally respond to anyone else's last-minute messages.

I considered proposing extending voting periods in these cases, but
that's really no fun as it blocks some good scams.  If you don't think
this is a good argument, feel free to propose it yourself. ;p]
