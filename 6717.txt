PROPOSAL TEXT:
Amend Rule 1367 (Degrees) by replacing
        - The available options are FAILING GRADE and each degree that
          the author does not have. The available options can change
          during the voting period.

        - The eligible voters are each active player at the time the
          decision is initiated.

        - Each player's voting limit on the decision is three, plus
          five for each  degree e held at that time (the high limit is
          so as to allow a player to cast votes for different titles
          and ensure that an inappropriate title is not awarded).

        - The specific thesis for which the degree is to be awarded is
          an essential parameter of the decision (but not the text of
          that thesis).

       When the Herald resolves the decision, e CAN and SHALL award the
       author the degree selected by Agora, or no degree if FAILING
       GRADE was the outcome.

        - The outcome is, rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
          highest-ranked degree such that more than half the votes cast
          were for that degree or a higher degree, or FAILING GRADE if
          there was no such degree.
