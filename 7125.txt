Adoption index: 3.0

Amend Rule 106, "Adopting Proposals", by replacing "its power is set
to the minimum of four and its adoption index" with "its power is set
to the minimum of four and its voting index".

In Rule 1950, "Decisions with Adoption Indices", after the third
paragraph, add a paragraph reading, "A person SHOULD NOT set a
proposal's adoption index so low that if it took effect with power
equal to its adoption index, it would be ineffective."
