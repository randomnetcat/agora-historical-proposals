Amend Rule 2290 "Chamber and Title" by replacing this text:

       A player CAN change eir Title by announcement if e has not
       already done so previously in the same month. In the same
       message in which a player submits a proposal, e CAN set its
       Chamber by announcement. Changes to Title are secured.

with:

       A player CAN change eir Title by announcement if eir Title has
       not changed in the same month. At the beginning of each month
       the title of all players whose title has not changed in the
       previous month and is the most common Title among players  is
       changed to the least common title among players. In the case of
       a tie, they are changed to the superior title and in the case
       all Titles are equally often possessed by players, nothing is
       done.

       In the same message in which a player submits a proposal, e CAN
       set its Chamber by announcement. Changes to Title are secured.

[Note that amending the original paragraph means that these auto-changes
could happen at most all two months to a single player, not every month.

"In the same message in which a player submits a proposal, e CAN set its
Chamber by announcement. Changes to Title are secured." is not changed,
itâ€™s just set to a new paragraph.]
