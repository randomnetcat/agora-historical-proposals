[[1:27:37] <Pavitra> [17:49:29] Transferring promises is (explicitly)
secured at power 3, and transferring liquid assets in general is only
power 2. Does this mean that promises are in general nontransferable?]

Amend Rule 2337 (Promises) by replacing:

     The creation, transferring, cashing, and destruction of promises
     is secured.

with:

     Creating and cashing promises is secured with power threshold 3;
     any other modifications to promise holdings are secured with
     power threshold 2.

[The other option would be explicitly authorizing it in the Promises
rule, but it's a bad idea to try to restrict things at a higher power
than the rule defining them.]
