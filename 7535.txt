Amend Rule 101 to read:

      Please treat Agora right good forever.

[  i. is meaningless.
  ii. was only considered to have an effect once, and it probably
shouldn't have been judged that way.  It is unlikely to ever be
generally violated.
 iii. and iv. are no fun.
   v. is guaranteed elsewhere.
  vi. is unlikely to ever be generally violated.
 vii. is almost meaningless and common sense.]
