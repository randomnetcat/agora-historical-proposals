Repeal Rule 754.

Amend Rule 217 (Interpreting the Rules) to read:

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence.  Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense,
      past judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the
      game.

      A term explicitly defined by the Rules, along with any of its
      ordinary-language synonyms not otherwise so defined, has that
      meaning when used in any Rule of equal or lesser power, or when
      used in a Rule of greater power that is clearly intended to
      comply with that meaning.  Otherwise, terms have their ordinary-
      language meanings; with definitions contained in lower-powered
      Rules providing non-binding guidance.

      Differences in spelling, grammar, capitalization, whitespace,
      dialect, or the use of synonyms or abbreviations, are generally
      inconsequential in interpreting rules or communications, as long
      they do not create ambiguity in meaning.
