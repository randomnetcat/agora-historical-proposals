Adoption index: 3.0

Change the power of Rule 2019 to 3.

Amend Rule 2019 by adding the following to the list of prerogatives,
with an appropriate numbering:
     f) Tiebreaker.  When an Agoran decision would be resolved with a
        voting index equal to its adoption index, the voting index is
        instead 0.001 more (if the most common value among the
        Tiebreaker's votes on that decision is FOR) or less (if the
        most common value is AGAINST).  If there is no single most
        common value or that value is neither FOR nor AGAINST, the
        voting index is unchanged.
