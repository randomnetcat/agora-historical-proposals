Amend Rule 2332 (Winning by Points) to read:
     A player CAN destroy 250 points in the possession of any indicated
     player to cause the indicated player to satisfy the Victory
     Condition of Accumulation.

[Currency systems are a balance of accumulation over time, but for
game balance, shouldn't let a player accumulate too much (otherwise
new players start out at huge disadvantages.  Ergs didn't allow enough
accumulation.  Having no leveling mechanism is too much accumulation.
This places an effective cap at 250 (a few months of play) above which
a reset can be forced in exchange for victory.  Also, by careful
management you can keep your holdings below the reset level).]
