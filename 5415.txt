Repeal Rule 2142 (Support Democracy).

[R2142 has been broken for a while now, as a result of the
simultaneous rejection of Proposal 5209 and adoption of Proposal 5210,
which apparently was arranged for the express purpose of subtly
breaking it.
Besides, we currently have the Veto, which effectively does the same
thing that R2142 did before it was broken.]
