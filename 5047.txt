Amend Rule 1950 by replacing the text reading:

    At the end of the voting period of an Agoran decision, the first
    N ballots submitted by each entity on that decision (where N is
    the entity's voting limit on the decision at the start of the
    voting period) remain valid; all other ballots submitted on that
    decision are invalid.

with the text:

    At the end of the voting period of an Agoran decision, the first
    N ballots submitted by each entity on that decision (where N is
    the entity's voting limit at the decision's ballot allotment
    time) remain valid; all other ballots submitted on that decision
    are invalid.

    The ballot allotment time of a proposal that becomes or ceases to
    be ordinary during the proposal's voting period is the time of
    the last such change.  The ballot allotment time of any other
    decision is the start of the voting period.

["Support Democracy" changes a proposal's AI and chamber
during the voting period, but the voting limits used are from the
start of the voting period, when the proposal was still Ordinary.]
