Title: Re-switchify chamber
Author: Murphy

Adoption index: 3

Amend Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) by replacing the paragraph
containing "The adoption index of a proposal is" with this text:

      The adoption index of a proposal is an integral multiple of 0.1,
      with a minimum value of 1.0.  It may be set by the proposer at
      the time of submission, or otherwise defaults to the minimum.

      Chamber is a proposal switch with values null, Ordinary (default
      for proposals with adoption index less than 2.0), and Democratic
      (default for all other proposals).  Immediately after the Agoran
      decision of whether to adopt a proposal is resolved, that
      proposal's chamber is flipped to null.
