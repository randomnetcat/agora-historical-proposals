{{
   coppro CAN, by announcement, cause this Rule to make any Rule
   Change e specifies. For the purposes of this rule, if coppro has
   publicly posted potential Rule Change that is substantially the
   same in content more than 72 hours prior, and if e has given full
   consideration to every comment and complaint brought against it
   (even if he chooses to ignore them), then any requirement for
   public review has been met for a Rule Change made by this rule.
