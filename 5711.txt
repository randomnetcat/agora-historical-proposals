Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by appending this text between the
sections on FINE and CHOKEY:

     * COMMUNITY SERVICE with a set of up to five tasks (the
       prescribed tasks) that the ninny CAN reasonably perform,
       appropriate for rule breaches of moderate consequence if the
       severity of the rule breach is reasonably correlated with the
       consequences of performing the tasks, and especially if any
       other available non-null punishment would be either unjust or
       insufficient.  The balance between compensatory and punitive
       service is left to the judge's discretion.  While a sentence
       of this type is in effect, the ninny SHALL perform the
       prescribed tasks (as soon as possible, unless a different
       time limit is specified).
