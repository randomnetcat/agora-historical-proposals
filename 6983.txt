[Currently, the following hypothetical case:

   Rule A: X MAY Y.
   Rule B: X MAY NOT Y.

 expands to

   Rule A: X doing Y does not violate Rule A.
   Rule B: X doing Y violates Rule B.

 which don't conflict with each other, so B effectively wins.  This
 proposal changes the expansions to

   Rule A: X doing Y does not violate the rules.
   Rule B: X doing Y violates Rule B.

 thus forcing a conflict, which is then resolved via precedence
 as usual.]

Amend Rule 2152 (Mother, May I?) by replacing this text:

      5. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
         rule in question.

with this text:

      5. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
         rules.
