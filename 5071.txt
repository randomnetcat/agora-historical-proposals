Title: judicial power realignment

Change the power of rule 217 to 2.

[R217 is the only judicial rule with a power of 3, which makes no
sense.  It started out at power=1, and this proposal brings it down to
the level of R991 "Invoking Judgement".  All other judicial rules have
power=1; some upmutation might be appropriate.]
