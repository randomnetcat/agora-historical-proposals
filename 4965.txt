Change the title of Rule 1871 (Turns for All) to "The Standing Court",
and amend it to read:

      Each player is either standing, sitting, or lying down.

      A player may change emself from sitting to lying down, or vice
      versa, by announcement.

      When a player is selected as Trial Judge of a CFJ, e changes to
      sitting.  A player is ineligible to be Trial Judge of a CFJ if
      e was not standing when it was called.

      When a player registers, e is lying down.

      The Clerk of the Courts may (without 2 objections) change a
      player to lying down.  E is encouraged to do this only if e
      expects the player to judge CFJs slowly or not at all.

      When the Clerk of the Courts publishes a Notice of Rotation, all
      sitting players change to standing.  The Clerk of the Courts
      shall only do so when all open CFJs without a Trial Judge have
      no players eligible to be assigned, and at least one of them has
      at least one player ineligible solely to not standing; e shall
      list all CFJs in the first set, and at least one in the second
      (noting at least one of the relevant players).  However, failing
      to meet these requirements does not deprive the Notice of effect.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, the Speaker and Clerk of the Courts
are changed to standing; all other players are changed to lying down.
