Arguments: Loads of people have, or will have, sufficiently many Notes
to do a Happy Birthday this Birthday; as it is, everyone's bound to try
to send their message as soon as the birthday begins, and we'll have a
huge mess figuring out who was first. Also, rushing to get there first
isn't particularly interesting. I'm not sure what the best solution to
this is: giving everyone the win is at least simple.
