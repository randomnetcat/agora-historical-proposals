Enact a rule, titled "Zlotys":

      Zlotys are a currency. The recordkeepor of zlotys is the General
      Secretary. Ownership of zlotys is restricted to persons and
      other entities defined by the rules as capable of holding
      zlotys.

      Whenever a first-class person registers, they are awarded one
      thousand zlotys, unless they have been awarded zlotys by this
      mechanism in the past.

Award one thousand zlotys to every first-class player.
