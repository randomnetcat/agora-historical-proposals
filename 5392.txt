Create a rule titled "Foreign Relations" with this text:

      Recognition is a foreign nomic switch, tracked by the
      Ambassador, with values Unknown (default), Protected,
      Friendly, Neutral, Sanctioned, Hostile, and Abandoned.

      When a foreign nomic becomes a Protectorate, its Recognition
      becomes Protected.  When a foreign nomic ceases to be a
      Protectorate, its Recognition becomes Unknown.  A foreign
      nomic's Recognition CANNOT change to or from Protected
      in any other way.

      The Ambassador CAN, without objection, flip a foreign nomic's
      Recognition to any value (subject to the above restriction).  E
      SHALL inform that nomic of the change as soon as possible.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, the Recognition of each of the
following is flipped to Neutral:
