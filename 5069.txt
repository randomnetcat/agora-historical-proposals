Amend rule 1868 to read

      Whenever a CFJ that has not been judged has no trial judge
      assigned, the Clerk of the Courts shall as soon as possible
      assign an eligible judge to it by announcement.  The assigned
      judge remains its trial judge until recused.

      Every active player is eligible to be assigned as a trial judge
      unless made ineligible by the rules.  Entities other than active
      players are always ineligible.

      If the Clerk of the Courts errs in good faith by assigning an
      ineligible judge then the assignment stands.  In this case, the
      Clerk of the Courts may recuse the judge by announcement
      accompanied by a description of eir error.

Repeal rules 698 and 2133.

[Puts the important bits of the three rules into one shorter rule.
Leaves out the crud, in particular R698's elaborate procedure for
situations that are much better handled by the new form of R1871.]

Amend rule 1871 by replacing the text "all open CFJs without a Trial
Judge" with "all CFJs awaiting trial judge assignment".

[The definition of "open CFJ" from R1868 was too restrictive.  This
does better without any special terminology.]

Amend rule 1826 by replacing the text "after a case is closed" with
"after a case has been judged".

[The term "closed CFJ" has also gone away.]
