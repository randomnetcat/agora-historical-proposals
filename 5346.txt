Amend Rule 591 (Inquiry Cases) by replacing this text:

      The judgement of the question in an inquiry case SHOULD guide
      future play, including future judgements, but does not directly
      affect the veracity of the statement.  The rulekeepor is
      ENCOURAGED to annotate rules to draw attention to relevant
      inquiry case judgements.

with this text:

      A judicial finding is a judgement of a question on veracity
      for which all time limits for appeal have expired.  A judicial
      findings SHOULD guide future play, including future judgements,
      but does not directly affect the veracity of the related
      question.  The rulekeepor is ENCOURAGED to annotate rules to
      draw attention to relevant judicial findings.

[Analogous to B Nomic's "pondered consultations".  Accounts for the
two-tier time limits for appeal in criminal and equity cases.]

Amend Rule 2110 (Win by Paradox) to read:

      Upon a judicial finding that the possibility of a prior or
      hypothetical rule-defined action, or the permissibility of
      a prior or hypothetical action, is UNDECIDABLE, the initiator
      of the related inquiry case wins the game if e is a player.

[Implicitly refers to time limits for appeals.]
