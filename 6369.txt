Adoption index: 1.0

Amend R2233 to read:
{{
Each contest has a threshold index (default: 5). Any player CAN set a
contest's threshold index to any non-negative integer value without
three objections.

The contestmaster of a contest CAN and SHALL award and revoke points
as directed by that contract up so long as the total number of points
awarded or revoked on any axis do not exceed that contest's threshold
index. Awards and revocations that counteract a previous award or
revocation for that contest that was not in accordance with it's
contract or that exceeded the contest's threshold index do not count
against this limit.
}}

Upon the adoption of this proposal set the threshold limit of each
contest to the below values:
{{
Enigma: 20
FRC: 20
Agoran Agricultural Association: 100
Cookie Jar: 20
Three-Scroll Rodney: 30
}}
