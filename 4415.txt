Proposal
Default Budgets and Election Errors

[Comment: players not infrequently forget to submit budgets during elections 
for offices that have budgets associated with them. I propose to let the 
current budget be the default, assuming it is valid.

I also propose to let election results stand after a week if they are 
unchallenged during that time, just as they are for referenda.]

Amend Rule 1958 (Nominating with Budgets) to read:

(a) If an office has a budget, then a nomination in an election for that 
office is not valid unless a valid proto-budget is associated with it.

(b) A proto-budget submitted by a nominee during the nominating period is 
associated with that nominee's nomination. A proto-budget is valid if it 
would be valid as a budget.

(c) If a nominee for an Office fails to submit a valid proto-budget during 
the nominating period, then by default eir nomination is associated with a 
proto-budget identical to the current budget for that Office. If the current 
budget is not valid, tough cookies.

(d) When the voting period begins, the vote collector shall announce each 
candidate's last valid proto-budget.

(e) When the voting period ends, the winner's last valid proto-budget 
becomes the budget of that office, and e shall announce it as soon as 
possible. If the election ends without a winner, then the existing Budget 
remains in effect.

Amend Rule 1445 (Defaults for Elections) by appending to the end of it a new 
paragraph which reads:

* Cutoff for Challenges: If the results of an Election are not challenged 
within seven days after the Vote Collector announces them, then the 
announced results are the true results of that Election, even if they would 
otherwise be in error.
