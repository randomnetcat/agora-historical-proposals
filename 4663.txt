[Patronage requires Power 2 to do what it does.]

Change the power of Rule 2077, and amend it by replacing the text:

      * Caption:  Patronage
        Elements: Grafty, Budgeted
        Exploit:  You may increase or decrease the Political Charge by
                  N by paying a fee of 4 times N.  If undefined
                  elsewhere, the Political Charge is a positive
                  integer, tracked by the Assessor, which begins at 4.

with:

      * Caption:  Patronage
        Elements: Grafty, Budgeted, Powered [2]
        Exploit:  You may increase or decrease the Political Charge by
                  N by paying a fee of 4 times N.  If undefined
                  elsewhere, the Political Charge is a positive
                  integer, tracked by the Assessor, which begins at 4.
                  No fee required by the Powered [X] element need be
                  paid to activate this exploit.
