Amend rule 591 to read

      The judge of a CFJ judges it by publishing eir judgement, along
      with any arguments, evidence, or other material that e considers
      relevant.

      For a trial judge, a judgement is exactly one of the following:
      TRUE, FALSE, or DISMISSED.

Amend rule 1826 to read

      A motion is a formal request made by a player to the judge of a
      CFJ.  A motion is made by announcement, which must clearly
      identify the CFJ to which the motion applies.

      The judge of a CFJ must either grant or deny each motion that
      applies to that CFJ within five days of it being made.  If a
      judge fails to grant or deny an applicable motion within five
      days of it being made, the Clerk of the Courts shall recuse the
      judge and assign a new one.  If a motion is made after a case
      has been judged, and the original judge of that case is not
      active or is not a player, then the Clerk of the Courts shall
      assign a new judge.

      A judge grants or denies a motion by publishing eir
      determination, along with any arguments, evidence, or other
      material that e considers relevant.  The effect of granting a
      motion depends on its nature, but generally amounts to requiring
      the judge to perform as requested by the motion.  A denied
      motion has no further effect.

Amend rule 1805 by replacing the text

      Appellate Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts by the Lead Judge of a Board of Appeals, but do not take
      effect until their publication by the Clerk of the Courts.

with

      Appellate Orders are executed by being published by the Lead
      Judge of a Board of Appeals.

[Makes everything in the judicial process work by announcement,
instead of indirectly via the CotC.]
