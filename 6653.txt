Amend Rule 1367 (Degrees) in the following ways:

Change the text reading:

      - Each player's voting limit on the decision is three, plus five
        for each degree e held at that time (the high limit is so as to
        allow a player to cast votes for different titles and ensure that
        an inappropriate title is not awarded).

to read:

     - Each player's voting limit on the decision is one.

Add the following text to the bulleted list:

     - Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the outcome of the
       decision is the highest degree such that more than half of the
       valid votes selected that degree or a higher degree. If no such
       degree exists, the outcome is FAILING GRADE.

[As of now, players can easily submit any proposal as II=0 to avoid
paying the fee associated with making it Distributable.]
