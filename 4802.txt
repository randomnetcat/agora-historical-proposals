Repeal rule 2094 (Corporate Players).

Change the title of rule 869 (Registered Players) to "How to Join
Agora", and amend it to read:

      A person who is not currently registered as a player and is not
      prohibited from registering may become a registered player by
      sending a message to a public forum which sets forth eir intent
      to register.

Amend rule 1677 (Honoring the New) to read:

      Readiness is a stuck player switch with values unready and
      ready.  A player may flip eir readiness to ready.

      Whenever a player registers who has not been registered within
      the previous year, e becomes unready and is subject to a Grace
      Period beginning immediately and lasting for sixty days, not
      including Holidays.  At the end of eir Grace Period, e becomes
      ready.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of a player's Grace
      Period, the Registrar shall announce eir arrival.  This
      announcement shall have the effect of setting that player's
      kudos to twice the Tabla Rasa.

      If a player joins the game, but is neither subject to a Grace
      Period nor has been a player at any time since the last Turning
      of a New Parchment, then the Herald shall set eir kudos to half
      the Tabla Rasa (rounded up).
