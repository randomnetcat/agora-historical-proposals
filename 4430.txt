Proposal: Lingering Grace

Extend the Grace Period of Cecilius until Fri 14 Feb 18:00:26.

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by striking out the phrase "Whenever
a person registers as a Player in Agora," and everything that follows it,
and substituting the following text:

	Whenever a person registers as a Player in Agora, and that person
has not been registered as a Player in Agora at any time within the 365
previous days, e becomes Unready and is subject to a Grace Period that
begins at the time of eir registration and ends sixty days afterwards,
unless otherwise provided by this Rule.  A Player is only subject to the
Grace Period resulting from eir own registration.

	Whenever:

(i) any Holiday occurs completely between the start of any Player's Grace
Period and its scheduled conclusion, or

(ii) any Player's Grace Period is scheduled to conclude during any
Holiday,

eir Grace Period shall be extended by a period of time equal in length to
that Holiday.

	For the purposes of determining when a Player's Grace Period is
scheduled to conclude, where more than one Holiday falls fully or
partially within that Grace Period, the calculation shall be made
separately for each Holiday.

	Whenever a Player's Grace Period concludes, e becomes Ready.
