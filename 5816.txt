Amend Rule 591 (Inquiry Cases) by replacing the paragraph beginning
with "An inquiry case has a judicial question on veracity," with
this text:

      An inquiry case has a judicial question on veracity, which is
      always applicable.  The valid judgements for this question are
      as follows, based on the veracity on the statement at the time
      the inquiry case was initiated:

      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
        true

      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
        false

      * UNDECIDABLE, appropriate if the statement was logically
        undecidable or otherwise not capable of being accurately
        described as either true or false

      * FLOYD, appropriate if the statement logically could have been
        consistently described as either true or false

      * UNDETERMINED, appropriate if the statement is nonsensical or
        too vague, or if the information available to the judge is
        insufficient to determine which of the TRUE, FALSE, UNDECIDABLE,
        and FLOYD judgements is appropriate; however, uncertainty as
        to how to interpret or apply the rules cannot constitute
        insufficiency of information for this purpose

      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement is
        not relevant to the game
