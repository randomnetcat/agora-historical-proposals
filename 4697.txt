This is my PROPOSAL called: True Pay Raise

Amend 1940 to read:

      The boon of Public Service exists for the purpose of awarding
      Officers for serving.

      Paperwork is a stuck switch for Offices with states Low and
      High.  The Assistant Director of Personnel is the recordkeepor
      for paperwork.  For the purpose of this rule, the Speaker and
      the Distributor are considered offices.  The Assistant
      Director of Personnel or the Speaker may switch the paperwork
      of an office with two supporters and without two objections.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the
      Assistant Director of Personnel shall award 1 Public Service
      Boon for each office to the player (if any) who held that
      office for 16 or more days in the previous month; e shall
      award an additional Public Service boon to that player if the
      office is a high paperwork office.

      Each office may make one Proposal distributable per month
      without payment of a fee, by the electee of that office
      publicly invoking that office's Civil Service Exemption.


Upon the adoption of this Proposal, the Offices of
Herald, Deckmastor, Clerk of the Courts, Promotor,
and Assessor become high paperwork offices.
