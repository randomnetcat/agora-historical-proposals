In Rule 2369, "Foreign Relations", add the following paragraph after
the first one:
      {
      Sanity is a foreign nomic switch, tracked by the
Ambassador-At-Large, with values Unknown (default), Sane, Insane and
B-level. Players SHOULD NOT attempt to make sense of what goes on in
Insane or B-level foreign nomics. Attempting to make sense of what
goes on in a B-level foreign nomic is the Class-2 Crime of Suffusion
of Yellow. The Ambassador-at-Large CAN, with Agoran Consent, switch a
foreign nomic's sanity to any value. The Ambassador-at-Large SHOULDN'T
switch a foreign nomic's sanity to Insane. Switching a foreign nomic's
value to B-level is the Class-4 Crime of The King in Yellow.
