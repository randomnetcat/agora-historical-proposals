Amend Rule 2246 to read as follows:

      A judicial case may be submitted to the Justiciar.  For such a
      case, the Justiciar CAN, in a timely manner and by announcement,
      either accept or reject the case. Until the time limit expires or
      the Justiciar rejects the case, the CotC CANNOT perform any duties
      with regards to the case; the only appropriate sentence for
      violations caused by this is DISCHARGE.

      If the Justiciar accepts the case, e replaces the CotC entirely
      with regards to that case; e receives all obligations and all
      powers with regards to it. This includes any secondary duties
      required to fulfill obligations (such as rotating the bench). This
      takes precedence over Rules that would otherwise assign duties
      and powers regarding a judicial case to the Clerk of the Courts.

      All persons are encouraged to submit a case to the Justiciar only
      when there is a good reason not to submit it to the Clerk of the
      Courts.
