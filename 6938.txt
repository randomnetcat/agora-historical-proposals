Title: Decondense ratification

Amend Rule 1551 to read:

      A public document is part (possibly all) of a public message.

      When a public document is ratified, rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding, the gamestate is modified to what it would be
      if, at the time the ratified document was published, the
      gamestate had been minimally modified to make the ratified
      document as true and accurate as possible.  Such a modification
      cannot add inconsistencies between the gamestate and the rules,
      and it cannot include a rule change unless the ratified document
      purports to include the text, title, and/or power of the rule
      being changed.   If no such modification is possible, or
      multiple substantially distinct possible modifications would be
      equally appropriate, the ratification fails.

      An internally inconsistent document generally cannot be
      ratified; however, if such a document can be divided into a
      summary section and a main section, where the only purpose of
      the summary section is to summarize information in the main
      section, and the main section is internally consistent,
      ratification of the document proceeds as if it contained only
      the main section.

      Text purportedly about previous instances of ratification (e.g.
      a report's date of last ratification) is excluded from
      ratification.

      Ratifying a public document is secured.
