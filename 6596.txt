      * Wild Card      - Indicate a player other than yourself. That
                         player is awarded a Leadership Token.

      * Witness Reward - You are awarded a Leadership Token.


Set the Frequency of Wild Card to 3, the Frequency of Dunce Cap to 5,
and the Frequency of Witness Reward to 1.
