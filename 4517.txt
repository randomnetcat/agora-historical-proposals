Amend Rule 1552 (Requirements for Ratification) to read:

        An Official Document is legally permissible to Ratify
        if and only if all of the following are true:

          a) The Rules required some specific Player to produce and/or
             maintain the document.

          b) The Rules required it to be published.  (A requirement
             that it be sent to all Players fulfills this criterion.)

          c) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error (COE).

          d) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
             Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.

          e) The information within the Document has not been
             superseded by a subsequent Document that contradicts
             it.  (This does not apply if a COE alleging the
             contradiction is in error is admitted.)

          f) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
             specifically excluded from Ratification.

        Ratification by Proposal is effective only if the Document is
        legally permissible to Ratify when the Proposal takes effect.
