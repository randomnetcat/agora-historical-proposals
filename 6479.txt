Any Agoran decision to decide the flag of Agora currently in progress
is terminated with no result.  The Herald is relieved of any
responsibility to hold such an election or conduct any part of it;
if e has been punished for failure to act with respect to such an
election, the punishment is canceled/removed.

Amend the Rule that was originally titled "Placeholder Arms" to have
the title "Agora Has No Flag" and the text:

  Ceci n'est pas un drapeau.
