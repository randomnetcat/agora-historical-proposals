Amend Rule 2075 by replacing the text reading:

      If no one has won the game in the last six months, then any
      Gambler may announce a Skunk, which shall trigger the effects of
      a true announcement of a win above, except that no boon shall be
      awarded.

with:

      If no true announcement of a winning hand or a Skunk has been
      made in the last six months, then any Gambler may announce a
      Skunk, which shall trigger the effects of a true announcement of
      a win above, except that no boon shall be awarded.
