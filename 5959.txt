Amend the rule titled "Agoran History" by adding the following at the
end of the first paragraph:

"The Book of History SHOULD take the form of an epic poem. In
particular, it should start in medias res, with an invocation of a
muse and a statement of theme; treat Agora as being the majority of
the universe, with references to the outside world only when
necessary; make use of epithets when referring to all important
characters; include sections of detail that are not in narrative form,
such as catalogues and long lists; feature long and formal speeches;
contain divine intervention, from gods either real or fictional; and
contain heroes that are larger than life. However, this should not
greatly impair its usefulness as a historical reference."
