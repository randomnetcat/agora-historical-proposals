Coauthor is Murphy.

Create the following rule, entitled "Mental Health":
        Madness is a person switch and a Nomic switch, tracked by the Mental Health
        Department; its values are Mad or Sane (default). All persons who have ever
        played Agora SHALL have their Madness set to Mad.

        The Mental Health Department is a low-priority office.

        The Mental Health Department's report must include the persons who are Mad
        that e can reasonably be aware of; due to the inconclusiveness of Early
        Agoran History, not all persons who have earned Madness need be included.

Upon adoption of this proposal, the Mental Health Department shall be filled
by pikhq.
[ Specify the kind of switch. ]
