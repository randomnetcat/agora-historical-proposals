Amend Rule 2126 (Voting Credits) by replacing this text:

      Voting Credits (VCs) are items that can be possessed by players
      and used to affect voting limits on ordinary proposals.  VCs
      CANNOT be affected except by the action of an instrument with
      power greater than or equal to the power of this rule.  VCs CANNOT
      be possessed by any entity other than a player: in any situation
      that would otherwise violate this condition, the offending VCs
      are lost or never gained.

      Each VC has a color.  If a player is meant to lose a VC of a
      color that e does not possess, then e loses a VC of eir Party's
      color instead; if e has no VCs at all, then the loss is waived
      (you can't get blood from a turnip).

      The assessor's report includes the number of VCs of each color
      possessed by each player.

with this text:

      Voting Credits (VCs) are a class of fixed assets that can be used
      to affect voting limits on ordinary proposals.  VCs CANNOT be
      affected except by the action of an instrument with power greater
      than or equal to the power of this rule.   Ownership of VCs is
      restricted to players.

      Each VC has a color.  Each color of VC is a currency.  If a player
      is meant to lose a VC of a color that e does not possess, then e
      loses a VC of eir Party's color instead; if e has no VCs at all,
      then the loss is waived (you can't get blood from a turnip).

      The Assessor is the recordkeepor of VCs.
