Adoption index: 1.7

Amend Rule 2169 (Equity Cases) by appending this text:

      If an announcement claiming to initiate an equity case regarding
      a private contract would otherwise be invalid solely because the
      contract does not exist or the initiator is not party to it, then
      it is valid, but its judge SHALL assign it a null judgement.
