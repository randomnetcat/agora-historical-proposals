Amend Rule 911 (The Board of Appeals) by changing "random selection"
to "selection".

Amend Rule 2024 (Linked Statements) by appending this text:

      If a Trial Judge is recused from a Linked CFJ, then it ceases
      to be Linked to any other CFJ.  If a Trial Judge is recused
      from two or more Linked CFJs in a single message, then those
      CFJs continue to be Linked to each other, but not to any other
      CFJs to which the Judge is still assigned.

Amend Rule 2032 (Errors in Judge Selection) by replacing this text:

      then that selection shall stand and the selected Player shall
      become a Judge of that CFJ or Appeal, as if e had been eligible
      to judge it.

with this text:

      then that selection shall stand and the selected Player shall
      become a Judge of that CFJ or Appeal, as if e had been eligible
      to judge it; unless the Clerk of the Courts points out eir
      error and makes a new selection before the selected Player
      returns Judgement.

Change the title of Rule 2035 (The Unready are Ineligible) to
"The Unready and Unnoisy are Ineligible", and amend it to read:

      While a player is unready, e is ineligible to be Judge of any
      CFJ.

      While a player is not noisy, e is ineligible to become Judge
      of any CFJ.
