Append the following to the rule titled "The Monster":
{{{
      Some types of Monster include a duration known as the tariff.
      When a Monster with a tariff is in effect, the Monster is
      active while all of the following are true, inactive otherwise:

      1) It is still in effect.

      2) At least one week has elapsed since it first took effect.

      3) Monsters of the same type on the same question on
         Monsterisation have been active for a total duration less than
         the tariff. (That is, if an active Monster is suspended and
         later reinstated or superseded by a similar Monster, then the
         defendant gets credit for time served prior to the
         suspension.)

      The CotC's report includes the status of all active Monsters.
