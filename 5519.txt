Amend Rule 1006 (Offices) by appending this text:

      The holder of an office CAN resign it by announcement, causing it
      to become vacant.  As soon as possible after an office becomes
      (or is created) vacant, the IADoP SHALL make at least one
      nomination for the office; this requirement is waived if another
      player so makes a nomination.
