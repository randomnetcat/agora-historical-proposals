Amend rule 1023 by deleting the item that defines "number" and then
changing the letters in all the top-level item labels to form a
consecutive sequence from "a".

[With scores now restricted to integers, each instance of "number" in
the ruleset either is discussing a value that is inherently a natural
number or is explicitly qualified as "rational" or some other subset
of the real numbers.  The default restriction of the meaning of
"number" rarely had any effect, and is now definitively dead wood.]
