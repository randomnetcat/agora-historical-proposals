      For the purposes of any determination defined by this rule,
      objections shall always be considered withdrawn if they were
      made prior to the announcement of intent to perform the action.

with this text:

      The above notwithstanding, if the action depends on objections,
      and an objection to it has been withdrawn within the past 24
      hours, then Agora is not Satisfied with the intent.

      A person CANNOT support or object to an announcement of intent
      before the intent is announced, or after e has withdrawn the.
      same type of response.
