Amend Rule 2170 (Who Am I?) by replacing this text:

      A public message's claim as to who published it is
      self-ratifying, unless the claim is self-contradictory, or a
      challenge of identity pertaining to the claimed publisher has
      been issued within one month before its publication.

with this text:

      A public message's (possibly implicit) claim as to the identity
      of its publisher is self-ratifying, provided that the claim is
      neither ambiguous nor self-contradictory, and no challenge of
      identity pertaining to the claimed publisher has been issued
      within one month before its publication.  Upon a judicial
      finding that the claimed publisher of one or more messages
      (hereafter the Sock Puppet) was not a person, if any of those
      claims have already self-ratified, then the judge SHALL as
      soon as possible publish a judicial declaration that the Sock
      Puppet was a person during one or more time periods, which
      SHOULD correspond to general belief prior to that finding.
