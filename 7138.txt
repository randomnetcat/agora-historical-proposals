Create a new Rule titled "Win by Paradox":

     A turtle is an inquiry case on the possibility or legality of a
     rule-defined action (actual or hypothetical, but not arising
     from that case itself, and not occurring after the initiation of
     that case) which has the judgement UNDECIDABLE.

     When a turtle has continuously been a turtle for one week, its
     initiator satisfies the Victory Condition of Paradox.
