Amend Rule 1430 (Mandatory Rule Annotations) by replacing the text that
reads:

      Whenever a Rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor shall
      record a historical annotation to the Rule giving the type of
      change, the source of the Change (that is, a reference to the
      Proposal and its Proposer, or Rule or other entity which
      mandated the Change) , and the date upon which the change took
      effect.  Other Rules may require additional information to
      appear in an annotation for certain types of Rule Change.
