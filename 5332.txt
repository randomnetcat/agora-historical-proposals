Amend the rule titled "The Senate" by replacing the sentence:

      During emergency session, any Senator may end a filibuster on a
      proposal with 4 supporting Senators.

with:

      Any Senator may end a filibuster on a proposal with 4 supporting
      Senators.

and by replacing the sentence:

      A proposal that ends its voting period in filibuster has a
      quorum of the number of eligible voters plus 1, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding, and its voting period is not extended
      due to lack of quorum.

with:

      A proposal that ends its voting period in filibuster has a
      quorum of the number of eligible voters plus 1, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

[Fixes two race conditions regarding filibusters.  As it stands, a
 filibuster at the very end of an emergency session or a proposal's
 voting period can kill that proposal completely, with no opportunity
 for the proponents of a legitimate proposal to respond.

 Neither of these changes weakens the rule much; a proposal for which
 the voting period is extended due to filibuster will remain in
 filibuster.]
