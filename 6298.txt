Amend bullet (d) of Rule 1922 to read as follows:

      (d)  Champion, to be awarded by the Herald to any person who
           wins the game, along with a specification (possibly
           implicit) of the method of victory.  The Herald's monthly
           report includes how the player won. A message awarding
           Champion to a player constitutes a self-ratifying claim that
           the player in question won the game through that method.
