Change rule 1950 (Voting Limits) to read:

    The voting limit of an eligible voter on a democratic proposal
    is one and cannot be changed except by this rule.

    The voting limit of an eligible voter on an ordinary proposal is
    one if not explicitly modified by other rules.

    The voting limit of an eligible voter who is not a natural person
    is always one less than it would otherwise be.

    After the voting period for an Agoran decision has ended, the
    vote collector shall permit the first valid ballots submitted by
    an eligible voter to remain valid, up to a number equal to that
    person's voting limit on that decision as determined when the
    voting period for that decision began, and shall invalidate all
    subsequent ballots submitted by that voter on that decision.
