Amend Rule 2230 (Notices of Violation) by replacing this text:

     A Notice that is still Uncontested four days after it is
     published automatically becomes Closed instead.

with this text:

     If a Notice is Uncontested and was published at least four
     days ago, any player CAN cause it to become Closed by
     announcement.
