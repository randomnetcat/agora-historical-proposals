Amend Rule 2181 (The Accountor) to read:

      The Accountor is a low-priority office; its holder is
      responsible for keeping track of miscellaneous assets.

      The Accountor's report includes a list of all classes of assets,
      and their backing documents and recordkeepors.

      The Accountor is the default recordkeepor for all assets whose
      backing document does not specify a different recordkeepor.
