Amend paragraph 3 of rule 869 (How to Join and Leave Agora) to read:
     A first-class person CAN (unless explicitly forbidden or
     prevented by the rules) register by announcing that e registers,
     wishes to register, requests registration, or requests
     permission to register.

Amend paragraph 5 of rule 869 to read:
     A player CAN deregister by announcement. A person CANNOT
     register within thirty days after being deregistered by any
     means other than by a mechanism that the rules explicitly
     describe as a means of honorable deregistration.

Remove the last paragraph of rule 1789 (Cantus Cygneus).
