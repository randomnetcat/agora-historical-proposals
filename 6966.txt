[There is no longer a mechanism for removing old undistributable
proposals from the pool, and while proposals now default to
Distributable, there is no way to make an existing Undistributable
proposal Distributable. AI-3 because removing proposals is secured.]

Each Undistributable proposal in the Proposal Pool is removed from the pool.
