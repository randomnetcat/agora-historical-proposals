Amend Rule 1950 (Voting Power) by appending to this clause:

      (d) An entity may cast as many votes as e wishes on a Proposal,
          in any combination, up to the limit determined by that
          entity's Voting Power on that Proposal, with the exceptions
          that:
              (1) no Player may vote on an Ordinary Proposal unless e
                  is a Shareholder at the time e casts eir vote.

the following text:

          Attempts to cast multiple votes simultaneously are
          considered equivalent to casting them one at a time,
          e.g. "2F+A" has the same effect as "FOR, FOR, AGAINST".
