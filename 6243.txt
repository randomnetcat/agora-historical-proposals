Amend Rule 2201 (Self-Ratification) to read:

      A public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
      ratified when it is continuously undoubted for one week.

      A doubt is an explicit public challenge via one of the following
      methods, identifying a document and explaining the scope and
      nature of a perceived error in it:

        a) An inquiry case, appropriate for questions of legal
           interpretation.

        b) A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact.  The
           publisher of the original document SHALL as soon as possible
           either deny the claim (causing it to cease to be a doubt) or
           publish a revision.
