Dissent!

[I've meant to get around to this for a bit]

[Add standard for CotC getting involved]

Amend Rule 2157 (Judicial Panels) by inserting this text:
      The CotC SHOULD consent to a majority action if the panel has
      made a reasonable effort to achieve consensus.

immediately after this text:
      A judicial panel CAN send messages by means of any of its
      members sending a message identified as being from the panel,
      with the unanimous agreement of the panel's members, or with the
      majority agreement of the members and the consent of the CotC.


Amend Rule 911 (Appeal Cases) by appending this text:
      In the week after the panel publishes a valid judgement, any
      panel member may publish a formal Dissenting Opinion with
      Support.  This Dissenting Opinion becomes a part of the record
      of the case, and SHOULD aid in interpreting the decision.

[Support doesn't need to come from a panel member.  This shouldn't collide
with Murphy's consenting opinions.  The "dissent" can happen even if the
members eventually agreed on a compromise verdict.  If consent and dissent
are both approved, we can split "consenting and dissenting" into its own
rule].
