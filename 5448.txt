If the text of rule 2156 contains the word "province", then amend rule 1950 to
read as follows:

     The eligible voters on a democratic decision are those entities
     that were either active first-class players or active provinces
     at the start of its voting period.  The voting limit of each
     eligible voter on a democratic decision is one.
