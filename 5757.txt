Amend Rule 2211 by replacing:
      The Grand Poobah is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of castes.
with:
      The Grand Poobah is an imposed office; its holder is responsible
      for keeping track of castes.
and by appending this item to the list of steps that the Grand Poobah
shall take:
        3) Imposition.  The Grand Poobah SHALL announce the identity
           of a player whose caste is Alpha: that player thereby
           becomes the Grand Poobah.

[The original would fail due to insufficient power, and probably cause
an infinite loop.]
