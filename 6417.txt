Amend Rule 649 (Patent Titles) by replacing "Awarding or revoking a
Patent Title by Proposal is a secured change." with "Awarding or
revoking a Patent Title can only be done by a proposal with power 1.5 or
greater."

[This change, while possibly substantiative, clears up an aspect of that
rule and makes it do what it intended to.]
