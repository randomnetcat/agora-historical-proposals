Proposal
Ought implies can

AI = 3, please.

Create a Power=3 Rule, entitled "Ought implies can", which reads:

      Other Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the failure to      
perform an action required by the Rules, where the person required      to 
act was not empowered to do so, shall never constitute the      commission 
of a Crime or Infraction.
