Amend Rule 2230 to read as follows:
{{
      Any person CAN publish a document alleging that a single entity
      (the Accused) has broken a Rule.  A person CAN make such a
      document into a Notice of Violation with 2 support, or by
      announcement if e has done so less than 3 times in the same Agoran
      Week. A Notice of Violation is invalid if it lacks any of the
      following information, and the lack is correctly identified within
      one week after the notice is published:
       (a) The identity of the Accused;
       (b) The allegedly illegal action/inaction in question;
       (c) The Crime that was committed;
       (d) The Severity of that Crime.

      Knowingly issuing a Notice of Violation with incorrect
      information is the Crime of Libel.

      A Notice of Violation is valid if and only if:
        (1) it clearly specifies the required information for a Notice
            of Violation;
        (2) no previous valid notice specified substantially identical
            information (i.e. the same violation for the same specific
            act);
        (3) the Crime is specified in the rules;
        (4) it clearly specifies a specific act (rather than, for
            example, a set of actions each one of which may be illegal).

      Neither a Notice's incorrectness (i.e. whether its allegation is
      false) nor its unfairness (i.e. whether the punishment resulting
      from leaving it Uncontested would be manifestly unfair according
      to the guidance of the Rules) affects its validity.

      As soon as possible after a player makes an announcement that is
      reasonably recognizable as an attempt to issue such a notice,
      the Insulator SHALL announce whether the Notice was valid.  Such
      an announcement is self-ratifying.  Affirming the validity of
      the notice does not in itself certify the correctness of the
      allegation.

      After a Notice of Violation has been published, any player CAN
      close it by announcement, provided e is the accused or it has been
      at least 7 days since the publication of the Notice of Violation,
      and that no criminal case has been initiated for that particular
      Notice of Violation. When a Notice of Violation is closed in this
      manner, a number of Rests equal to the Severity of the specified
      Crime are created in the accused's possession.

Amend Rule 2143 by removing "Class 2".

Amend Rule 2202 by removing "Class-8".

Amend Rule 911 by removing "Class-N".

Create a new power-2 rule entitled "Crimes":
{{
      A Crime is an offense against Agora, committed by violating a rule
      of Agora. There are two types of Crimes - Generic and Specific. A
      Specific Crime is an action defined as being a Crime by the Rules,
      and such a definition implicitly defines the action as being
      illegal. A Generic Crime is any violation of a Rule that is not a
      Specific Crime.

      Every Specific Crime has a name given to it by the Rule defining
      it, while each Generic Crime's name is "Violating Rule N",
      where N is the ID Number of the Rule being violated. If multiple
      Crimes have the same name, they are the same Crime.

      Severity is a Crime switch, tracked by the Insulator, with values
      equal to each integer between 0 and 24, inclusive. Changes to
      Severity are secured. Any player CAN flip a given Crime's Severity
      without objection, or without 2 objections if the new value is
      within 2 of the old value. A Specific Crime's default Severity is
      the Power of the Rule defining it, rounded up; a Generic Crime's
      default Severity is the Power of the Rule for which it is a
      violation, rounded up.

      When issuing reports containing the Severity of Crimes, the
      Insulator need not list a Generic Crime if its Severity is at its
      default value.
}}

For each Crime that was defined in the Rules prior to the adoption of
this proposal, flip its Severity to the Class it had prior to the
adoption of this proposal.

Amend Rule 2125 by replacing
{{
      d) The rules explicitly state that it MAY be performed while
         certain conditions are satisfied.  Except as allowed by the
         rules, performing such an action is the Class-N Crime of
         Restricted Behavior, where N is the maximum power of the
         rules explicitly allowing it (rounded up as needed to become
         a valid Class of Crime).

{{
      d) The rules explicitly state that it MAY be performed while

         rules allowing it to be performed legally.

Amend Rule 1504 by removing "Players SHOULD NOT create rules defining
Crimes of a Class greater than 14." and "When a judicial question on
culpability is judged after a number of rests have been created in the
Accused's posession due to the associated notice, those rests are
destroyed.", by replacing
{{
      Criminal cases are a subclass of judicial cases.  Any
      first-class person can initiate a criminal case by an
      announcement calling for judgement on the circumstances
      surrounding a specified valid Notice of Violation alleging a
      rules breach by a single entity (the Accused).  The initiator
      and each member of the Accused's basis are unqualified to be
      assigned as judge of the case.

        broken by rounding up, are created in the possession of the
        Ninny.  The judge CAN, with 2 Support, set the fine at a
        different integral level between one half and double that
        amount, and SHOULD attempt to do so if necessary to ensure
        that the correlation between the fine and the severity of the
        breach is appropriate, or to account for the faith (good or
        bad) shown by the Ninny in contesting the notice or in aiding
        or obstructing the course of justice.

      * SILENCE, a number of Rests are created in possession of the
        Ninny, to be determined by the judicial question on severity.

      A criminal case has a judicial question on severity, which is
      applicable if the question on sentencing is applicable and has
      a judgement of SILENCE.

      The valid judgments for the judicial question on severity are the
      nonnegative integers within 2 of the Severity of the Crime
      breached by the Ninny. When the judicial question on severity is
      assigned a judgment, a number of Rests equal to the judgment are
      awarded to the Ninny. In addition, any player CAN, within the
      next two weeks and without 4 objections, set the Severity of that
      Crime to the judgment, unless the judgment has been set aside or
      the question on severity is inapplicable.

      If the judge believes that the Severity of the Crime does not give
      him the leeway to assign an appropriate number of Rests, e MAY and
      SHOULD delay eir judgment long enough for em to make a
      reasonable attempt to change the Severity of that Crime. The CotC
      SHOULD NOT recuse for lateness a judge attempting to change the
      Severity of a Crime.

[Note: this is not a comprehensive list of rule violations. Rather, it
picks some key points in the rules where several ways to violate a rule
exist and they should be distinguished so as to allow different
penalties. Rules where many SHALLs exist (such as Equity Cases and Grand
Poobah) were not considered as they will require more exacting
consideration.]
