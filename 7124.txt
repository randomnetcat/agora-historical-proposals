[I forgot to specify AI 2 for P7117 and misstated a rule number.  It
created a Power-1 rule but did nothing else.]

Change the Power of the Rule titled "Costs" to 2.

Retitle Rule 2349 (Spending Points) to "Spending Actions", and amend it
to read:

    A Spending Action is an action defined as such by the Rules.
    Base cost is a Spending Action switch, tracked by the
    Scorekeepor, whose value is a non-negative integer (default 5).
    A player CAN change a Spending Action's base cost without two
    objections.  The cost of a Spending Action is generally its base
    cost in points, subject to modification by other Rules.

Amend Rule 1607 (The Promotor) by replacing "as a Spending Action"
with "for a cost of 5 points".

Amend Rule 2332 (Winning by Points) by replacing:

    A player CAN destroy 250 points in the possession of any
    indicated player to cause the indicated player to satisfy the
    Victory Condition of Accumulation.

with:

    A player CAN destroy 250 points in the possession of any
    indicated player as a cost to cause the indicated player to
    satisfy the Victory Condition of Accumulation.

Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing "class of asset" with
"currency", and by replacing:

    When in effect, the ninny SHALL, as soon as possible, either
    destroy this amount of eir asset or transfer it to the Lost and
    Found Department. The ninny is only obliged to perform one
    destruction or transfer per case, even if sentences of this type
    are assigned more than once or go into effect more than once.

with:

    The ninny CAN satisfy the fine by announcement, for a cost of
    that amount of currency.  When in effect, if e has not already
    done so in the same case, the ninny SHALL satisfy the fine as
    soon as possible.
