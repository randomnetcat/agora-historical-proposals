Create a rule titled "Veto and Rubberstamp" with Power 2 and this text:

     Vetoing an ordinary decision during its voting period increases
     its adoption index by 1 and makes it Democratic.  Vetoing a
     decision under other circumstances has no effect.

     Rubberstamping an ordinary, non-filibustered decision during its
     voting period decreases its quorum to 3, rules to the contrary
     notwithstanding.  Rubberstamping a decision under other
     circumstances has no effect.

Amend Rule 2255 (Major Arcana) by replacing this text:

     Title:  Majority Leader.
     Position: The Majority Leader CAN veto a specified ordinary
     decision in its voting period by announcement; this increases
     its Adoption Index by 1 and makes it Democratic.

     Title: Cabinet Secretary.
     Position: the Cabinet Secretary CAN rubberstamp an ordinary,
     non-filibustered decision in its voting period by indicating the
     decision; this decreases its quorum to 3, rules to the contrary
     notwithstanding.

with this text:

     Title:  Majority Leader.
     Position: The Majority Leader CAN veto a specified decision by
     announcement.

     Title: Cabinet Secretary.
     Position: the Cabinet Secretary CAN rubberstamp a specified
     decision by announcement.
