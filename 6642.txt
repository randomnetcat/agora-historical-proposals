{{{
Enact a new rule at power 2, entitled {Conditional Actions} with the
following text:
{{
     An action that would otherwise be performed by announcement is
     performed conditionally when, in a public message, the performer
     announces that e will perform an action if a certain condition is
     met. The action is said to be performed conditionally on that
     condition; it is a conditional action.

     Actions SHOULD NOT be performed conditionally except to reduce
     ambiguity in the game state (e.g. to repeat an action that may
     or may not have failed).
}}

Amend Rule 2283 (Fees) by appending the following text:
{{
     Players SHALL NOT perform fee-based actions conditionally. Doing
     so is the Class-4 Crime of Increasing Uncertainty.
}}
[It's made a class-4 so that players are encouraged to prefer
performing actions unconditionally but incorrectly over
conditionally.]
