Amend R2069 by replacing the text:
          A Gambler may Draw from The Deck for a Fee equal to the
          number of times that Gambler has previously Drawn from the
          Deck during the current month so long as the Gambler's Hand
          Size is smaller than the Maximum Hand Size plus the number
          of Offices e holds.  For the purposes of this Rule, the
          Speakership is considered an office.

With:
      A Gambler whose Hand Size is smaller than the maximum Hand Size,
      plus the number of Offices e holds, plus one if e is Speaker, may
      draw a card from The Deck.  The fee for this action is a number of

      Kudos equal to the number of times during the current month e has
      previously drawn a card in this manner.
