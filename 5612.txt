Ivan Hope and Pavitra are co-authors of this proposal.

Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing this text:

      * INNOCENT, appropriate if the defendant did not perform the
        alleged act

with this text:

      * INNOCENT, appropriate if the defendant did not perform the
        alleged act within 200 days before the case was initiated

      * OVERLOOKED, no longer appropriate, retained to avoid
        invalidating past judgements

and by removing this text:

      * OVERLOOKED, appropriate if the alleged act allegedly occurred
        at least 200 days before the case was initiated
