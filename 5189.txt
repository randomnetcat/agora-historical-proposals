In Rule 2152 replace the following text:

      4. CAN X ONLY IF Y:  Equivalent to "CANNOT X unless Y".  Similar
         for (MUST, MAY, SHALL, SHOULD) X ONLY IF Y.

      5. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY:  Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.

      6. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Before failing to perform
         the described action, the full implications of failing to
         perform it should be understood and carefully weighed.

with:

      4. CAN: Attempts to perform the described action are successful.

      5. MAY: Performing the described action is permitted.

      5. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY:  Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.

      6. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Before failing to perform
         the described action, the full implications of failing to
         perform it should be understood and carefully weighed.

[[[
I think CAN X ONLY IF Y belongs in a proposal similar to 5171, rather than
in this rule which concerns itself with word and simple phrase definition.

MAY and CAN are useful definitions (MAY is used in rule 1067 already)
