Amend rule 889 by deleting the text

      The CotC's Monthly Report shall include the Stare Decisis, which
      is a list of past CFJs.  The following information shall be
      included for each CFJ:

        (i) its statement;
       (ii) the date on which it was called;
      (iii) its outcome (if any) on Judgement; and
       (iv) its outcome (if any) on Appeal.

      Whenever a CFJ is made, the CotC shall add it to the list.  E
      may, at eir discretion, add earlier CFJs.  E may Without
      Objection remove any CFJ e deems no longer relevant from the
      list.

[We're not in practice using the Stare Decisis report, and it was
never a really useful form of the information anyway.  Its purpose is
better served by annotations in the FLR.  Dropping the report does not
drop the *principle* of stare decisis, of course, which is enshrined
in rule 217.]
