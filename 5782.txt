Title: Fix panels

Adoption index: 2.0

Upon the adoption of this proposal, the gamestate becomes what it would
be if all panel assignments that were invalid solely due to one or more
panelists being unqualified to judge the prior case due to hawkishness
were instead valid.

[While webifying the assign-panel script, I discovered that viewcase.php
still listed hanging judges as eligible for panels pertaining to inquiry
cases, similarly for hugging and criminal.  That's been fixed now.]
