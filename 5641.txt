Amend rule 2199 (Ribbons) as follows:

     Ribbons are gained as follows, unless the player already
     possesses the color of Ribbon to be gained:

with the text:

     A player becomes eligible for a ribbon as follows:

2) Replace all instances of "gains" with "becomes eligible for"
3) Before the last paragraph insert the text:

     If a player has become eligible for a ribbon within the last 7
     days and does not already have that ribbon, any player CAN award
     em that ribbon by announcement. Any such announcement is
     ineffective unless it clearly and unambigiously specifies the
     event that made the recipient eligible.
