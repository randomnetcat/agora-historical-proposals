Adoption index: 1.7

Amend Rule 911 (Appeal Cases) by replacing the paragraph beginning
"A panel CAN publish a concurring opinion" with this text:

     Any panel member CAN publish a formal Concurring Opinion with
     panel member support, provided that the panel has judged AFFIRM,
     and SHOULD do so if and only if the reasoning by which the prior
     judge reached eir judgement was incorrect in whole or part.  A
     Concurring Opinion SHOULD explain the nature of the error(s)
     in the prior judge's reasoning.  Each Concurring Opinion has an
     error rating, an integer from 1 to 99, with larger numbers
     corresponding to larger errors in reasoning; it CAN be specified
     in the announcement of intent, or else defaults to 50.
