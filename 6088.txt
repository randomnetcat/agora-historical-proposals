Reduce the power of rule 2217 to 1, and change its text to:
{{{
     Within a week (or month, if the office is low-priority) after an
     elected office ceases to have (or is created without) an active
     holder, or after an election for the office ends and the office
     still lacks an active holder, the IADoP SHALL initiate an election
     for that office.  This requirement is waived if the office comes
     to have an active holder, or if another player initiates an
     election for the office.
}}}
