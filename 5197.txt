      b) A player may spend three VCs of different colors to increase
         eir own VVLOP by one.

      c) A player may spend two VCs of different colors to decrease
         another player's VVLOP by one (to a minimum of zero).

      d) A player may spend three VCs of different colors to decrease
         another player's VVLOP by ten percent.

      a) A player may spend N+1 VCs of different colors to increase
         another player's VVLOP by N, where N >= 1.

      b) A player may spend N+2 VCs of different colors to increase
         eir own VVLOP by N, where N >= 1.

      c) A player may spend N+1 VCs of different colors to decrease
         another player's VVLOP by N (to a minimum of zero).

      d) A player may spend N+2 VCs of different colors to multiply
         another player's VVLOP by (10-N)/10, where 1 <= N <= 10.

[Generalises all current ways to spend VCs on VVLOP, to produce
progressively greater per-VC effect as the number of colors involved
rises.  With rare colors around, this introduces a tension between the
efficiency of spending more colors at once and the desire to collect
all colors for the palette win (if that's adopted).  In some cases
it's even worth transferring VCs (via the one-for-two mechanism) in
order to cooperate in a VC spend.]
