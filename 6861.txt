Amend Rule 2309 by replacing:

         2) For each of those rules, submit a disinterested proposal
            with AI equal to that rules' power. One proposal SHALL
            specify only to repeal its rule; the other SHALL specify
            only to amend its rule.

with:

         2) For each of those rules, submit a disinterested proposal
            with AI equal to that rules' power. One proposal SHALL
            specify only to repeal its rule, and, if necessary, to
            make a minimal set of other rule changes so that the game
            is not broken by the repeal; the other SHALL specify only
            to amend its rule.

[We have the same problem now that we did with the Anarchist:
proposals to repeal rules out of context are dramatic, but almost
always would break the game and are thus voted down.]
