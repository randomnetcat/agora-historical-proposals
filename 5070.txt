Retitle rule 402 to "Office of Speaker" and amend it to read

      The speaker is an office.

      If an active player who is not the speaker has won the game
      within the past week, e may become the speaker, thus removing
      any previous speaker from the office, by announcement, unless
      someone else has become speaker within the preceding 90 days.
      If the legality of an attempted installation of this type is not
      challenged within a week, then it is effective even if later
      found to be illegal.

      A speaker who became speaker within the preceding 90 days cannot
      be replaced by Agoran Consent if e is one of those whose
      objections are counted in the Agoran Consent procedure.

[Making the speaker an office means we can make use of officer
defaults elsewhere, such as the IADoP reporting the officeholder.
Change installation by "any player" to self-installation to prevent
someone becoming speaker involuntarily.  More explication of the
restrictions on replacing a speaker.  Drop the "inattentive speaker"
bit because the speakership is no longer a critical administrative
office.]

Amend rule 1006 by replacing the text "an Officer or the Speaker" with
"an officer".

[With the speaker being an officer, this is now redundant.]
