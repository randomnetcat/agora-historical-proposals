Amend Rule 2124 (Agoran Satisfaction) by replacing this text:

      An Objector to a dependent action is a first-class player

with this text:

      An Objector to a dependent action is a first-class player (or
      other person explicitly allowed to object to that action by the
      rule allowing that action to be performed dependently)

[Amending R2198 to use this is left to a separate proposal, as I'm
not sure offhand of the status of previous efforts to amend R2198.]
