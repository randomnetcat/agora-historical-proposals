In R2166 replace the following paragraph:

      Each asset has exactly one owner.  If an asset would otherwise
      lack an owner, it is owned by the Lost and Found Department.  If
      an asset's backing document restricts its ownership to a class
      of entities, then that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred
      to an entity outside that class, and is destroyed if it is owned
      by an entity outside that class (except for the Lost and Found
      Department, in which case any player CAN transfer or destroy it
      without objection).

with

       Each asset has exactly one owner.  If an asset would otherwise
       lack an owner, it is owned by the Lost and Found Department.  If
       an asset's backing document restricts its ownership to a class
       of entities, then that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred
       to an entity outside that class, and is transfered to the Lost
       and Found Department if it is owned by an entity outside that
       class.  If an asset is owned by the Lost and Found department
       any player CAN transfer or destroy it without objection.

       The Lost and Found department may own any asset regardless of
       restrictions placed upon an asset by its backing document.
