Upon the adoption of this proposal the Points Relay Service contract
is amended as described below:

Append to Section 6:
{{
No more than 10 points may be awarded to a single Awardee this way each week.
}}

Create a new section which reads:
{{
An Awardee CAN specify a number of points to "request credit" by
announcement. As soon as possible after doing so the contestmaster
SHALL attempt to revoke that number of points from the Awardee. For
each point successfully revoked this way the contestmaster SHALL
create one PV in eir possession.
}}

Repeal section 7 [[with the inclusion of metering this is no longer necessary]]
