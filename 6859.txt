Amend rule 2255 to change the Influence Levels of each of the following
Positions, in order, to the given values:

Kitchen Staff Supervisor: 8
Justiciar: 5
Grand Vizier: 3
Head Gardner: 3
Crown Prince: 1

[Reduce the disparity between highest and lowest somewhat; 8/5/3/2/1 was
the standard back in the days of Clout. An influence level of 0 also
leads to weirdness due to players being able to move there for free,
potentially repeatedly; and this helps to avoid our persistent Rest
deflation by reducing voting limits and thus causing individual Rests to
have more of an effect.]
