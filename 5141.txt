Adoption index: 2

Amend rule 2156 by replacing the text "is eir EVLOP at the start of
its voting period." with

      is eir EVLOP at the start of its voting period, or half that
      (rounded up) if the voter is in the chokey at the start of the
      voting period.

[Make chokey do something significant.  Doesn't affect Democratic
proposals, though, because that would be undemocratic.]
