Enact a rule with title "Official Reports" and text:

      For each office, the rules may designate certain information
      to be part of the corresponding officer's weekly report or
      monthly report.  Any information designated to be part of the
      officer's report without specifying which report shall be part
      of the weekly report.  If no information is designated to be
      part of the weekly (or monthly) report, then that office has
      no weekly (or, respectively, monthly) report.  Each officer's
      report is an official report.

      The holder of an office for which there is an officer's
      report is obliged to maintain all information in the report.
      E is obliged to publish the weekly report, if there is one, at
      least once each week, and the monthly report, if there is one,
      at least once each month.
