[ Officers don't lose a month's salary just for missing one deadline, which
is especially unfair for the CotC. Assuming infractions pass, they should
be used to dock tardy officers a proportionate amount of pay. ]

Amend Rule 2402 (Office Salary) by replacing "for which:
       a) the officeholder held the office for at least two weeks
          continuously in the previous month, and
       b) the officeholder completed all duties required of em as a
          result of holding the office during that month, within any
          time limits for doing so." with "for which the officeholder held
the office for at least two weeks continuously in the previous month."
