Amend Rule 2343 (Victory Conditions) by inserting this paragraph after
the second paragraph:

     The remainder of this rule notwithstanding, if an event's Victory
     Deadline has passed, then a person CANNOT Win the Game due to
     that event, and its Victory Deadline CANNOT be extended.  An
     event's Victory Deadline is initially 28 days after the event,
     and CANNOT be extended except as specified by this rule.  If it
     is within 28 days of passing, then anyone CAN extend it by 28
     days by announcement.  (Initiating, assigning a judge to, or
     judging a judicial case substantially relevant to the event
     implicitly counts as such an announcement.)
