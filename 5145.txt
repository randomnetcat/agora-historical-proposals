Title: regularise speakership

Adoption index: 3

Amend rule 402 by deleting the paragraphs that start "If an active player"
and "A speaker who became".

Repeal rule 103.

[Murphy's proposals turn the speaker into a regular administrative office.
With that sort of duties, there's no reason for the special provisions
regarding installation into office.  R103 goes because we have no greater
need for the speaker than for any other office, and the R402 provisions
being deleted concern installation of game winners into office and a
restriction on replacing the speaker.]
