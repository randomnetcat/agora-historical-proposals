Title: Ordinary until proven Democratic

Adoption index: 3.0

[NOTE: With the move to cards proposals can now easily be made
democratic with a card, or with the traditional support. There is
little harm done in making proposals ordinary by default, and thereby
increases the competition for the higher castes.]

In R2196 replace: {{
An Agoran decision with an adoption index greater
      than or equal to 2 is democratic.  Any other Agoran decision
      with an adoption index is ordinary by default.
}}
with:
{{
All Agoran decisions with an adoption index are ordinary by default.
}}
