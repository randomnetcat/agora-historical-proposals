Amend Rule 683 (Voting on Agoran Decisions) by replacing this text:

     where N is the entity's voting limit on that decision.

with this text:

     where N is the entity's voting limit on that decision as of the
     end of its voting period.

Amend Rule 2156 (Voting on Ordinary Decisions) to read:

     The eligible voters on an ordinary decision are the players who
     were active at the start of its voting period. The voting limit
     of a player on an ordinary decision is defined as follows:

followed by just the numbered items from Rule 2279 (Voting Limits on
Ordinary Decisions).

Repeal Rule 2279.

Amend Rule 2280 (Implicit Votes) to read:

     When an eligible voter on an Agoran decision casts ballots
     without explicitly specifying the number (e.g. "FOR" instead of
     "FOR*1" or "FOR*3"), the number is considered to be equal to eir
     voting limit on that decision.
