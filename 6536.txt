Adoption index: 2

Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by removing the last paragraph.

Create a new rule titled "Appeals of Criminal Cases" with Power 2 and
this text:

       An appeal concerning any assignment of judgment in a criminal
       case within the past week CAN be initiated by the accused by
       announcement.

       Unless otherwise specified, an appeal of a judgment in a criminal
       case is assumed to be appealing the question of culpability.

       If a verdict or sentence that led to the creation of Rests is
       overruled, remanded, or reassigned, the Rests are still considered
       to have been created, but any player CAN destroy any Rests thus
       created by announcement.

       When a judgement on a criminal case's question of culpability is
       suspended, the judgement (if any) on its question of sentencing
       is also suspended.  Afterward, if the first judgement is assigned
       again, then so is the second.

[Refactor the stuff from R1504 for readability, fix a grammar nit, and
prevent simultaneous appeals of both culpability and sentencing.  R911's
block against appealing the same question twice shouldn't apply, as the
second judgement's reapplication is directly caused by this new rule,
and only indirectly caused by an appeal judgement.]
