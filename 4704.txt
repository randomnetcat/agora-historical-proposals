Rewrite R 2085 (Mute Exemption) to read as follows:

      A Legislator who is Mute may, with two support, submit a body
      of text, labeled a Mute Exemption Proposal which acts as if it
      were a normal Proposal if it meets all rule requirements for a
      Proposal other than the Proposer not being Mute.

      As soon as possible after a Proposal with Mute Exemption passes,
      the Assessor shall expunge a number of Blots from the Proposer
      equal to the Adoption Index of the Proposal.  In the event that
      the Adoption Index is greater than 5 then a maximum of 5 blots shall
      be expunged. The Proposer shall receive no Boons that may have
      awarded by other rules for the passing of the Proposal.
