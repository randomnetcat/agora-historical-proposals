If a rule titled "The Dictionary" exists, amend it to read as follows;
otherwise, enact it, with the following text:

      The Dictionary is a list of common terms and shorthands used in
      playing Agora and their definitions.  A player CAN add a
      definition to the Dictionary without objection, and a player CAN
      remove a definition from the Dictionary with Agoran Consent.
      Persons SHOULD NOT object to the addition of a definition unless
      the definition is pointless or disruptive.

      When, in a public message, an entity uses a term defined in the
      Dictionary, unless there is explicit indication otherwise, the
      message is to be interpreted using the definition in the
      Dictionary.  Terms defined in the Dictionary have no effect on
      the interpretation of the rules, except insofar as they may lead
      to the formation of game custom.

      A definition in The Dictionary cannot cause a message to result
      in an action or other consequence that would not be possible
      without that definition.

      The Lexicographor is an office; the Dictionary is included in
      its monthly report.

(The rule's old text is somewhat broken in that it's possible to add
disruptive definitions, and that the words "except" and "of" are
missing. This proposal fixes those problems.)
