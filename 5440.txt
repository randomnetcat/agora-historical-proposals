Create a new rule titled "Ostracism" with the text:
{{
As soon as possible after the beginning of each month the IADoP SHALL
initiate an Agoran Decision to ostracize. In this decision the valid
options are the players, quorum is 3/4 the number of active players
(rounded down), the eligible voters are the active players, and the
vote collector is the IADoP. In the notice to resolve the decision,
the IADoP SHALL select the one player who received the greatest number
of votes (if any). For the next 30 days following the successful
resolution of this election, that player's voting limit is 0 on all
proposals. This rule takes precedence over other rules that would
otherwise set or change a player's voting limit.
