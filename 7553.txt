Amend Rule 2034 (Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges) by removing:

      Any proposal that would otherwise change the validity of any
      existing vote on any specific unresolved Agoran decision is
      wholly without effect, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
      This does not prevent amendment of the rules governing the
      validity of votes on Agoran decisions in general.

      Once an Agoran decision has been resolved, votes on it CANNOT be
      validly submitted or retracted, and its outcome CANNOT be
      changed in any way, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.  This
      does not prevent correcting errors in reporting its resolution.

[Paragraph 1 is trivial to circumvent; the part of paragraph 2 about
submitting and retracting is guaranteed by R683, and the part about
the outcome changing is unnecessary.]
