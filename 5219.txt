Revoke every instance of the patent title "Zeitgeist" from every
bearer of it.

[As I recall, the Zeitgeist title was defined to be revoked from the
previous bearer each time it was awarded.  It's not defined now, and
it's not obvious whether it was revoked from the last bearer.  The
herald's report indicates uncertainty about whether the title was
revoked from *any* bearer.  This plenary revocation means that the
herald can stop listing the historical awards of Zeitgeist, just like
any other revoked title.]

Revoke the patent title "Distributor" from Steve.

[This was meant to identify the person responsible for the mailing
lists.  Steve hasn't had that role for a long time.  The patent title
was superseded in this identifying role longer ago than that, as the
herald's note about CFJ 1298 indicates.]

Revoke the patent title "Boor" from each bearer of it.

[This title was part of the Wizard system.  It was held by anyone with
negative Style.  Everyone's Style got reset to zero every quarter, so
the title was never intended to be borne indefinitely.]
