Create a rule with Power=3.01 and this text:

      Upon the creation of this rule, the Gamestate becomes what it
      would have been if Steve's Voting Power on Democratic Proposals
      had been continuously equal to 2 from October 1, 2003, at 00:00:00
      UTC, to November 30, 2003, at 23:59:59 UTC.  In particular, this
      ensures that the following proposals have been adopted and have
      taken effect:

           4532     Clean Up Oligarchy Removal
           4533     Bolshevik Revolution of 2003, with Glasnost
           4534     Clean Up Oligarchy Removal, take 2
           4540     Boon of Zeitgeist
           4542     Pragmatize Scoring

      One second after the creation of this rule, this rule is repealed.
