Title: Kick out inactive officers quickly

Amend Rule 2160 (Deputisation) by replacing "held by an active player"
with "filled".

Amend Rule 1006 (Offices) by adding, at the end of the paragraph
starting with "The holder of an elected office CAN resign it", the
text:
      Any player CAN cause an office to become vacant without
      objection.

[Currently, the requirements for deputisation are:
- empty: you can deputise as soon as there is an obligation
- filled by inactive player: you need to wait for the time limit to
expire, but no need for intent
- filled by active player: you need to wait for the time limit to
expire and intend 2 days earlier

I don't really see the point of the middle ground here, so this
proposal removes it.  The without objection mechanism is more flexible
and quicker.  If a recordkeepor goes away, whether e becomes inactive
or not, e should be replaced ASAP to prevent disruption.]
