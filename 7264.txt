[I've been playing a little BlogNomic recently; meanwhile, even with
enhanced (but old-fashioned) veto and rubberstamp powers, nobody wants
to be Speaker...]

Repeal Rule 2366 (Veto and Rubberstamp).

Amend Rule 693 (Agoran Decisions) by removing the final paragraph.

In Rule 2127 (Conditional Votes), replace "a vote of PRESENT is cast"
with "the vote does not select any option.", and append a paragraph:

      Casting a vote for PRESENT is equivalent to endorsing the
      Speaker (the vote is conditional on the identity of the
      Speaker).
