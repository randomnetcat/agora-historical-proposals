Enact a new power 2 rule with the following text:
 {{
Fool SHALL respect the long tradition of players relinquishing the
dictatorship after a time and not actually abusing it.

Fool CAN cause this rule to amend itself by announcement, provided he
states that he does so in the name of Davy I, Queen of Agora Nomic,
CAT 24, and her other realms.
