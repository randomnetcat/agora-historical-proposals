Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by appending this item to the list of
valid sentences:

     * DELAYED PUNISHMENT, appropriate if the ninny is not a player at
       the time of sentencing.  After a sentence of DELAYED PUNISHMENT
       goes into effect, the next time the ninny registers (or
       immediately if e is registered when the sentence goes into
       effect), e commits the Class-N Crime of Illegal Entry, where N
       is the Class of the Crime that led to the sentence (or, in the
       absence of such a Crime, the power of the rule violated).
