Amend Rule 1950 (Decisions with Adoption Indices) by removing:

     Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
     For this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, and the
     adoption index and Chamber are initially the same as the
     corresponding values from the proposal.

Amend Rule 1607 (Distribution) by replacing:

     A player specifically permitted by the Rules to distribute a
     Proposal CAN distribute the proposal by publishing it with the
     clear intent of distributing it.  When a proposal is
     distributed, it is removed from the Proposal Pool.  The
     distribution of a proposal initiates the Agoran decision of
     whether to adopt the proposal, as described elsewhere.  Removing
     a proposal from the Pool by a means other than initiating an
     Agoran Decision to adopt it is secured.

with:

     Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
     For this decision, the vote collector is the Assessor, the
     adoption index and Chamber are initially the same as the
     corresponding values from the proposal, and the text of the
     proposal is an essential parameter.  Initiating such a decision
     is known as distribution, and removes the proposal from the
     Proposal Pool.
