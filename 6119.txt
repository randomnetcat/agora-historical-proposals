Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing:
               The judge CAN double the amount of the fine with 2
       Support, and SHOULD attempt to do so if e believes the Ninny
       showed bad faith by contesting an obviously-correct notice or
       by obstructing the course of justice.

with:
               The judge CAN, with 2 Support, set the fine at a
       different integral level between one half and double that
       amount, and SHOULD attempt to do so if necessary to ensure
       that the correlation between the fine and the severity of
       the breach is appropriate, or to account for the faith (good
       or bad) shown by the Ninny in contesting the notice or in
       aiding or obstructing the course of justice.
