[Sorry Rulekeepor!

There's nothing wrong with idiosyncrasy, and this one is certainly old
- the definition of "as soon as possible" as "within a week" was
introduced in 1994, as a patch for a previous definition which, I
believe platonically, required performing as-soon-as-possible actions
"before performing any other actions which have a less strictly
defined time requirement".  However, I've always thought the
definition is unusual enough to be actively misleading to new players,
so here is my attempt to heartlessly murder it.

The previous version was broken and "in a timely fashion", which
already exists, is obviously better wording than "within a standard
period", what was I thinking?]
