Amend R107 (Initiating Agoran Decisions) by replacing:
                         Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
        voting period for a decision with at least two options cannot be
        shorter than seven days.

        The voting period for a decision with at least two options
        cannot be shorter than seven days.


Amend R2284 (Fee-based actions) by replacing:
        - A player CAN make a proposal Distributable for a charge of 1
          erg.
with:
        - A player CAN make a non-urgent proposal Distributable for a
          charge of 1 erg.

        - A player CAN make an urgent proposal Distributable for a
          charge of 3 ergs.


Enact the following rule, Power-3, Urgent Proposals:

        A Proposal is Urgent if it is Interested and the text of the
        message wherein it is submitted explicitly states that it is
        an Urgent Proposal.

        The Promotor CAN distribute an Urgent Proposal as soon as it
        becomes Distributable, and e SHALL do so within four
        days unless it becomes undistributable in the mean time.
        Failure to do so is the Class 1 Crime of Lack of Urgency.

        Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the Voting Period of
        an Agoran Decision to adopt an Urgent Proposal is initially
        four days, and cannot be shortened.

["notwithstanding" clause now overrides R107.  Still allows quorum
extension.]
