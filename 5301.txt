Change the title of Rule 2175 (Excess CFJs) to "Judicial Retraction
and Excess", and amend it to read:

      If a judicial case has not had any judge assigned to it, then:

        a) Its initiator CAN retract it by announcement, thus causing
           it to cease to be a judicial case.

        b) If its initiator previously initiated five or more cases
           during the same Agoran week as that case, then the Clerk
           of the Courts CAN refuse it by announcement, thus causing
           it to cease to be a judicial case.
