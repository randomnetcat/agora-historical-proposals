Adoption index: 2.0

Amend Rule 2186 (Victory) by replacing this text:

      A win announcement is a factually correct announcement
      explicitly labeled as a win announcement and/or clearly stating
      that one or more persons win the game.

with this text:

      A win announcement is an announcement meeting all of these
      requirements:

        a) It is factually correct.

        b) It is explicitly labeled as a win announcement and/or clearly
           states that one or more persons thereby win the game.

        c) If it was a win announcement, then it would cause one or more
           Winning Conditions to be satisfied, as defined by other
           rules.
