Amend Rule 1006 (Offices) by removing this text:

                                   As soon as possible after an
     elected office becomes (or is created) vacant, the IADoP SHALL
     make at least one nomination for the office; this requirement is
     waived if another player so makes a nomination.

Amend Rule 2217 (Periodic Elections) by replacing this text:

      a) During a quarter, if the office was Temporal at the start of
         that quarter and no such attempt was made during the
         previous quarter.  This requirement is waived if another
         player makes such a change during the current quarter.

      b) Within a week (or month, if the office is low-priority)
         after the office ceases to have an active holder, or after
         an election for the office ends and the office fails to have
         an active holder.  This requirement is waived if the office
         comes to have an active holder during that week (month).

with this text:

      a) During a quarter, if the office was Temporal at the start of
         that quarter and no such attempt was made during the
         previous quarter.

      b) Within a week (or month, if the office is low-priority)
         after the office ceases to have (or is created without) an
         active holder, or after an election for the office ends and
         the office still lacks an active holder.  This requirement
         is waived if the office comes to have an active holder.

     These requirements are also waived if another player initiates
     an election for the office.
