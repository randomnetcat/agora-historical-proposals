Amend Rule 1922 (Defined Regular Patent Titles) by replacing
section (e) with this text:

      (e)  Minister Without Portfolio, to be awarded by the Herald to
           any player who wins the game and does not already bear the
           title.  If the number of persons bearing this title is
           greater than the number of Prerogatives defined by the
           rules, then this title is administratively revoked from
           all non-players; if it is still greater, then this title
           is administratively revoked from the Speaker.
