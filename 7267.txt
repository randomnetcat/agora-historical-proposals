 Enact the following Rule, Insanity Clause, power-1:

       An Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule letter.
       (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
          better.)

       For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
       there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
          bended.
       Nor shall a Player Vote in public, and its Chamber is the
       Star.
       So the Votes are unknown to others, no matter who they are.

       And should a Player split eir votes 'tween FOR and
           AGAINST like crazy,
       E will annoy Assessors (who are known for being lazy)
       So should eir votes cast differ from each other, this Rule's
           broke,
       With the breaker being the voting Player, as sure as if e'd
           spoke.

       And should such a Proposal's Voting Period begin,
       but no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

 [Note: it doesn't work, because private votes are not votes.]
