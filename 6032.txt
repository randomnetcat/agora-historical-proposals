In R2156 (Voting on Ordinary Decisions), replace:
The
 voting limit of an eligible voter on an ordinary decision is eir
 caste at the start of its voting period, reduced to the next
 lower caste (minimum Savage) for each positive multiple of 4
 Rests that the voter posesses at the start of the voting period.
with:
 The voting limit of an eligible voter on an ordinary decision is set
to eir caste at the start of its voting period, and may be changed
after it is set as allowed by the rules.  Changing a voting limit on
an ordinary decision is secured. At the end of the voting period, for
each 4 Rests a voter possessed at the start of the voting period, eir
voting limit on each ordinary decision is halved, rounding up.

[Doesn't completely eliminate voting rights for anyone with Rests
anymore, applies punishments to note-adjusted voting limits after
they're adjusted, and clarifies that "is" didn't really mean "is"]

In the rule "Notices of Violation", replace:
  A valid Notice of Violation is initially Uncontested if a Crime
  is named, Contested otherwise.
with:
  A valid Notice of Violation is initially Uncontested.
