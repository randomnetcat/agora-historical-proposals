Amend Rule 107 (Initiating Agoran Decisions) by replacing the
paragraph beginning with

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.

with this text:

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  The minimum and initial voting period
      is seven days.  The maximum voting period is fourteen days.

      The above notwithstanding, a decision with less than two options
      has no minimum voting period, and its vote collector CAN and
      SHALL end the voting period by announcement that also resolves
      the decision.
