Amend Rule 2154 (Replacing Officers) by replacing this text:

      If an office is Temporal at the end of a quarter, and no attempt
      to install a player into that office was made during that
      quarter, then the IADoP SHALL make at least one such attempt
      during the following quarter, and SHALL make the change if
      possible; however, these requirements are waived if another
      player makes such a change during the following quarter.

with this text:

      The IADoP SHALL make at least one attempt to install a player
      into an office, and SHALL make the change if possible, under
      the following circumstances:

        a) During a quarter, if the office was Temporal at the start
           of that quarter and no such attempt was made during the
           previous quarter.  This requirement is waived if another
           player makes such a change during the current quarter.

        b) Within a week (or month, if the office is low-priority)
           after the office ceases to have an active holder.  This
           requirement is waived if the office comes to have an
           active holder during that week (month).
