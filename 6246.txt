Amend Rule 2227 (Interest Index of Offices) to read, in full:

      Each office has an interest index, tracked by the IADoP.

      A player CAN set an office's interest index without objection, or
      without 2 objections if e holds the office.

[currently not tracked by anyone; and uses "flip" even though it isn't a
switch]
