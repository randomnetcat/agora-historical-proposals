[Attaches SHOULD requirements to actual people, not to inanimate
objects, so that the MMI definition works.]

In rule 2247 ("The Janitor"), replace
{{{
     These proposals SHOULD NOT modify any substantive aspect of the
     meaning of the rules.
}}}
with
{{{
     The Janitor SHOULD ensure the proposals e submits do not modify
     any substantive aspect of the meaning of the rules.

In rule 2170 ("Who Am I?"), replace
{{{
     the judge SHALL as soon
     as possible publish a judicial declaration that the Sock Puppet
     was a person during one or more time periods, which SHOULD
     correspond to general belief prior to that finding.

In rule 754 ("Definition Definitions"), replace
{{{
         The following clauses, where X and Y are both nouns or noun
         phrases, SHOULD be interpreted as "X is/are defined as Y":

with
{{{
         The following clauses, where X and Y are both nouns or noun
         phrases, mean "X is/are defined as Y" unless they obviously
         have a different meaning:
}}}
[This is a substantive change; the previous version of the rule didn't
actually change the meanings of rules, just caused people to act if they
were different; that's pretty much deliberately forcing the platonic and
pragmatic gamestates to diverge!]

In rule 754 ("Definition Definitions"), replace
{{{
     In determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term,
     definitions contained in lower-powered Rules, followed by
     definitions used in contracts or other Agoran legal documents,
     SHOULD be used for guidance.

with
{{{
     In determining the ordinary-language meaning of a term,
     definitions contained in lower-powered Rules, followed by
     definitions used in contracts or other Agoran legal documents,
     are relevant and may provide guidance in helping to determine
     the meaning of a rule, but are not binding (especially if they
     differ greatly from the definitions that would be used otherwise).
}}}
[Likewise.]

In rule 2152 ("Mother, May I?"), replace
{{{
     The following terms are defined.  These definitions are used
     when a rule includes a term in all caps, and SHOULD be used when
     a rule includes a term otherwise.  Earlier definitions take
     precedence over later ones.  If a rule specifies one or more
     persons in connection with a term, then the term applies only to
     the specified person(s).

[For the same reason as the R754 fixes, and also to avoid some weird
recursion.]

In rule 2152 ("Mother, May I?"), replace
{{{
     7. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Before failing to perform
        the described action, the full implications of failing to
        perform it should be understood and carefully weighed.

with
{{{
     7. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Before failing to perform
        the described action, the full implications of failing to
        perform it should (in the ordinary-language sense) be
        understood and carefully weighed.
}}}
[Let's settle this old argument legislatively. Besides, SHOULD in the
passive makes little sense with the MMI definition; the
ordinary-language definition is the one that is clearly intended here.]

In rule 2153 ("Interest Index"), replace
{{{
     An entity's interest index is an integer from 0 to 3, default
     value 1.  An entity's interest index SHOULD be proportional to
     its complexity.
}}}
with
{{{
     An entity's interest index is an integer from 0 to 3, default
     value 1.  When altering an entity's interest index, a person
     SHOULD try to pick a new value which reflects the complexity of
     that entity.
}}}

In rule 106, replace
{{{
     A
     proposal SHOULD outline changes to be made to Agora, including
     enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making other explicit
     changes to the gamestate.
}}}
with
{{{
     When creating proposals, the person who creates them SHOULD
     ensure that the proposal outlines changes to be made to Agora,
     such as enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making other
     explicit changes to the gamestate. When a proposal that includes
     such explicit changes takes effect, those changes are applied to
     the gamestate.
}}}
[Hopefully not a substantive change. The definition of "takes effect" is
added because it was a little unclear what it meant before, this
clarification of the SHOULD unfortunately makes it even more unclear,
and it's very very important that it has the meaning we want so as to
make gamestate changes possible.]

In rule 2224 ("Interest Index of Proposals"), replace
{{{
     A proposal SHOULD be disinterested if and only if its effects
     are limited to correcting errors and/or ambiguities.
}}}
with
{{{
     The submitter of a proposal SHOULD set its interest index to 0 if
     and only if the proposal's effects are limited to correcting
     errors and/or ambiguities.

In rule 591 ("Inquiry Cases"), replace
{{{
     The judgement of the question in an inquiry case, and the
     reasoning by which it was reached, SHOULD guide future play
     (including future judgements), but do not directly affect the
     veracity of the statement.

with
{{{
     Players SHOULD take the judgement of the question in an inquiry
     case, and the reasoning by which it was reached, into account when
     attempting to determine what is possible and/or legal in future
     play (including when making future judgements); but the judgement
     does not directly affect the veracity of the statement.
}}}

In rule 2169 ("Equity Cases"), replace
{{{
     the Appeals Court SHOULD assume

with
{{{
     the members of the relevant judicial panel SHOULD assume

In rule 2205 ("Judicial Arguments and Evidence"), replace
{{{
     Matters of legal interpretation SHOULD be classified as
     arguments; matters of fact SHOULD be classified as evidence.
}}}
with
{{{
     When submitting arguments and/or evidence, a player SHOULD
     classify matters of legal interpretation as arguments, and matters
     of fact as evidence.

In rule 911 ("Appeal Cases"), replace
{{{

with
{{{

(in both places the sentence fragment in question occurs).

In rule 911 ("Appeal Cases"), replace

     of the case, and SHOULD aid in interpreting the decision.
}}}
with
{{{
     This Dissenting Opinion becomes a part of the record

In rule 2231 ("Order of the Hero of Agora Nomic"), replace
