Amend Rule 1586 (Definition and Continuity of Entities) by replacing
this text:

     Two Rule-defined entities CANNOT have the same name or nickname.

with this text:

     If multiple rules attempt to define an entity with the same
     name, then they refer to the same entity.  A rule-defined
     entity's name CANNOT be changed to be the same as another
     rule-defined entity.

Amend Rule 2161 (ID Numbers) by appending this text:

     (f) If an instance of that type has an ID number, then its name
         is the combination of its type and ID number.  Otherwise, it
         has no name.
