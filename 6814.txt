The Pariah is an elected office, with no reports. Whenever a player
becomes the Pariah, that player is awarded 23 Rests.

If more than 6 Rests are destroyed in the Pariah's possession in any
given week, the Pariah is awarded a sufficient number of Rests in order
to bring eir net Rest loss that week up to no more than 6.

the Pariah, even really minor ones.

Upon a win announcement that the Pariah has ever continuously had 0
Rests for an entire week whilst being the Pariah for all of that time,
then the Pariah satisfies the Winning Condition of Cleanliness. Cleanup
