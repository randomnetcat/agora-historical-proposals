Minster Fix

Amend Rule 402 by replacing:
      The Herald's report includes the date on which each Minister
      Without Portfolio most recently won the game.
with:
      The Herald's report includes the date on which each Minister
      Without Portfolio most recently was awarded the title.

[e.g. pikhq was awarded the title by proposal, but never won
      the game].
