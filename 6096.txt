Change the Power of Rule 2223 (Win by Junta) to 3, and amend it to read:

      When a rule's text comes to include the exact sentence "X CAN
      cause this rule to make arbitrary rule changes by announcement.",
      except with X replaced by a list of one or more explicitly
      specified persons, then all those persons satisfy the Winning
      Condition of Dictatorship.

      Cleanup procedure:  One second later, that rule is amended by
      removing that sentence (and repealed if it thereby becomes empty),
      rules to the contrary notwithstanding; using that rule to prevent
      this is Bad Form.  Those persons SHOULD amend the rules to prevent
      this condition from being achieved again in essentially the same
      way.
