Amend Rule 412 (Government) by replacing item e) with:

      e) Chief Whip. The Chief Whip's voting limit on an Ordinary
         decision is 1.5 times what it would otherwise be, rounded
         down, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.

[add RttCN, which may or may not be necessary]

and by replacing:

      g) Committee Chairman. The Committee Chairman CAN, if e has not
         already done so to a given proposal, subject a specified
         proposal in the Proposal Pool to Death by Committee by
         announcement; this flips the proposal's Distributability to
         0. If e has not already done so in the current week, the
         Committee Chairman CAN give a specified proposal in the
         Proposal Pool Committee Approval by announcement; this
         doubles the proposal's Distributability.

with:

      g) Committee Chairman. The Committee Chairman CAN give a
         specified proposal in the Proposal Pool not authored by em
         Committee Approval by announcement; this increases its
         distributability by one.
