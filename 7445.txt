Amend Rule 2338 (Cashing Promises) by removing:

      If a promise is possessed by the Tree, any player except the
      promise's author CAN transfer it to emself by announcement, if e
      cashes the promise in the same message in which e transfers it
      to emself.

and by replacing "in eir possession" with "in eir possession, or in
the Tree's possession if e is not its author,".
