Amend R107 (Initiating Agoran Decisions) by replacing:
                               The vote collector for a decision with
     less than two options CAN end the voting period by announcement,

with:
                               The vote collector for a decision with
     less than two options CAN and SHALL end the voting period by
     announcement, if it has not ended already, and

[creates an open-ended requirement which allows this power to be deputized].


Amend R2154 (Election Procedure) by inserting, immediately after the
paragraph labeled '3)', the following paragraph:

     4) If there are no valid options for the Decision, instead of
        initiating the Decision, the IADoP SHALL, in place of initiating
        the decision, announce this fact, ending the election.  If
        there is exactly one valid option for the Decision, the IADoP
        SHALL, in place of initiating the Decision, announce the valid
        option (the candidate), thus installing that candidate into
        the office and ending the election.
