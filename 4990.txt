Enact a rule with title "Truthfulness" and text:

      Players are prohibited from deliberately or recklessly making
      false statements in any public message.  Merely quoting a false
      statement does not constitute making it for the purposes of this
      rule.  Any disclaimer, conditional clause, or other qualifier
      attached to a statement constitutes part of the statement for
      the purposes of this rule; the truth or falsity of the whole is
      what is significant.
