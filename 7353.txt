Title: Renaissance unribbonworthiness

Adoption index: 1.0

In Rule 2387 "Ribbons", replace the sentence "When a player is awarded
the Patent Title Champion, e earns an Ultraviolet Ribbon." with "When
a player is awarded the Patent Title Champion, if e does not possess
the Patent Title Renascent, e earns an Ultraviolet Ribbon." [The
Transparent Ribbon is intended to make subsequent wins by Renaissance
more difficult, by giving people who haven't yet won by Renaissance a
head start; however, this head start is negated if people who win by
Renaissance get a ribbon for it.]
