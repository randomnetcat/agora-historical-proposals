Adoption index: 3.0

[The intent was to prevent cases where the minimal modification to the
gamestate required to make something true might be some random (and
ill-defined) rule change, not prevent a proposal of the form "Repeal
Rule NNNN" from self-ratifying.]

Amend Rule 1551 (Ratification) by replacing:

      and it cannot include a rule change unless the ratified document
      purports to include the text, title, and/or power of the rule
      being changed.

with:

      and it cannot include a rule change unless the ratified document
      explicitly mentions that an action defined by the rules as a
      Rule Change was performed, or purports to be (a portion of) a
      format of the ruleset.
