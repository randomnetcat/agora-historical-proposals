Create a rule entitled "Contreras Card Labs" with the following text in
the category "The University of Agora":

      The University encourages Card experimentation.
      
      A Player may publish a piece of text and note that it is a Card 
      Blueprint.  If this text contains a Caption, a copy of that Card 
      is created in the possession of the Library.  The Card Blueprint 
      may also specify Elements and Exploits, as defined by other rules, 
      and these are included on the Card in the same way they would be
      if they were included on a rules-defined Card.

      Cards created by this method have a Quota of 1 and are considered 
      to be in eir Trial Run.  A Card in its Trial Run may not be checked
      out of the Library until seven days have passed since its creation.
      Any player may destroy a Card in its Trial Run by announcing e does
      so.  

      A Card in its Trial Run is transferred to the Library after it is
      played.

Amend 2068 (The Deckmastor) by changing the text that reads:

      Only the Deckmastor may create or destroy Cards, and

to read:

      Only the Deckmastor may create or destroy Cards not in eir Trial
      Run, and
