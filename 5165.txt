Amend rule 2126 by inserting in the list of ways that VCs can be
gained (and lost, if both are in a single list), immediately after the
last item that mentions red VCs, the new item

      (+O) When an interested proposal is adopted by voting with no
           valid votes AGAINST, its proposer gains one orange VC
           unless e gained a VC in this way earlier in the same week.

and then inserting in the list of ways that VCs can be lost (and
gained, if both are in a single list), immediately after the last item
that mentions either red VCs or orange VCs, the new item

      (-O) When an interested proposal is rejected by voting with no
           valid votes FOR, and having met quorum, its proposer loses
           one orange VC.

[A zeitgeist award and its complement.  Orange is chosen as the
rainbow color adjacent to red, which is used for the related proposal
awards.  The award is limited to once per week, like the red proposer
and coauthor awards, to avoid problems when one player makes several
proposals together.]
