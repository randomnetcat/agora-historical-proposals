In Rule 2337 "Promises", before the paragraph beginning with "To
submit a promise", add the following paragraph:

      When a person specifies items b) and c) above, common sense must
      be used to determine whether the statement they provide is the
      condition itself, or a description of the condition. A statement
      such as "The date is after June 30, 2013" should be interpreted
      as being the condition itself; a statement such as "This promise
      is not destroyed when cashed" should be interpreted as a
      description of the condition.
