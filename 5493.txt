Adoption index: 1.7

Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing this text:

      Some types of sentence include a duration known as the tariff.
      When a sentence with a tariff is in effect, the sentence is
      thereafter either active or not.  The sentence is inactive for
      the first week after it first takes effect.  Thereafter, the
      sentence is active if and only if it is still in effect and
      sentences of the same type on the same question on sentencing
      have been active for a total duration less than the tariff.  The
      CotC's report includes the status of all active sentences.

with this text:

      Some types of sentence include a duration known as the tariff.
      When a sentence with a tariff is in effect, the sentence is
      active while all of the following are true, inactive otherwise:

        1) It is still in effect.

        2) At least one week has elapsed since it first took effect.

        3) Sentences of the same type on the same question on
           sentencing have been active for a total duration less than
           the tariff.  (That is, if an active sentence is suspended
           and later reinstated or superseded by a similar sentence,
           then the defendant gets credit for time served prior to
           the suspension.)

      The CotC's report includes the status of all active sentences.
