Overtime

Amend R2187 by appending the following:

   If no players have won by High Score in the past four months,
   then any Player may place Agora into Overtime with 3 Support.
   When Agora is in overtime, any announcement awarding or
   revoking points that is authorized by another Rule awards or
   revokes double the amount of the announcement.  Agora ceases
   being in overtime when someone wins by High Score.
