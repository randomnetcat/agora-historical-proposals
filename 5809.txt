Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing the descriptions of
UNIMPUGNED and INNOCENT with this text:

    * INNOCENT, appropriate if the defendant did not violate the
      specified rule by performing the alleged act

[Combines INNOCENT ("I didn't do it") and UNIMPUGNED ("it's not
against the law"), which have been confused more than once.]

[Identical to Proposal 5788 except for AI and II.  5788 would have
passed 9/1 if it had been democratic.]
