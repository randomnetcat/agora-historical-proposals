Adoption index: 2

Amend rule 2154 by replacing the first paragraph with

      Any player CAN make an active player (hereafter the nominee) the
      holder of an office, thus removing any previous holder from the
      office, with Agoran Consent, provided that the nominee consents
      to hold the office after the announcement of intent is made.

[Remove 30 day time limit.  That was a pain recently, when we needed
to repair officeholding and we'd used the consent procedure shortly
before.  Worse, we weren't sure whether the time limit was in play or
not.  We could prohibit or deprecate rapid reinstallation, instead of
invalidating it, but I think players' taste and the election procedure
will effectively discourage frivolous nominations.]

Change the power of rule 1006 to 2.

[Contains pretty basic definitions, should be more difficult to
break.]

Amend rule 1006 by replacing the first two paragraphs with

      A role is an office if and only if it is so defined by the
      rules.  Each office at any time either is vacant (default) or is
      filled (held) by exactly one player.  The holder of an office is
      an officer, and may be referred to by the name of the office.

[No default officeholder, because the automatic installation into
office spreads confusion if there is any uncertainty about the
identity of the default officeholder.  Vacant offices are not a
problem: we can install someone by Agoran Consent fairly quickly, and
while the office remains vacant its duties can be performed by
deputisation.]

Amend rule 2161 by deleting the parenthetical clause that starts with
"(or, if".

[Don't need a default assigner of ID numbers.  Every rule that
mandates ID numbers makes an office responsible, and if the office is
vacant then we can assign numbers by deputisation.]
