Amend Rule 1742 (Contracts) by removing this text:

      A public contract is a contract that identifies itself as such.
      Any other contract is private.

Change the Power of Rule 2178 (Public Contracts) to 1.5, and amend it
to read:

      A public contract is a contract that has been identified as such,
      as specified by this rule.  Any other contract is private.

      A member of a contract CAN identify it as a public contract by
      publishing its text and membership, provided that at least one of
      the following is true:

        (a) The contract contains a clause identifying it as public.

        (b) The publication is accompanied by a notice, indicating
            unanimous consent of members, that the contract be public.

        (c) The publication is accompanied by a notice, published
            without objection of its members, that the contract be
            public.

      A partnership CAN identify its contract as a public contract by
      publishing its text and membership.

      If the text of a potential contract is published with a clear
      indication that the contract will be public when it forms, then
      it is identified as a public contract when it becomes a contract.

      Changes in the text or membership of a public contract do not
      become effective until they are published.
