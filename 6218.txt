[Identical to previous version, which narrowly failed quorum but
was otherwise unanimously supported.]

Amend Rule 2160 (Deputisation) to read:

      Any player (a deputy) CAN perform an action as if e held a
      particular office (deputise for that office) if all of the
      following are true:

        (a) The rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
            holding that office, to perform the action (or, if the
            office is vacant, would so require if the office were
            filled).  This requirement is fulfilled by the deputy
            performing the action.

        (b) A time limit by which the rules require the action to be
            performed has expired, or the office is vacant.

        (c) If the office is held by an active player, then the deputy
            announced between two and fourteen days earlier that e
            intended to deputise for that office for the purposes of the
            particular action.

        (d) It would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
            other than by deputisation, if e held the office.
