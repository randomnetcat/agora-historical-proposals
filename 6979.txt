If the rule "Voting on Democratic Decisions" contains the word
"ordinary", then enact a new rule, titled "Voting on Ordinary
Decisions":

{VLOP is a person switch whose possible values are the positive
integers, defaulting to 1. If a person's VLOP is N, then they CAN, by
announcement, spend N Dragons of different colors to increase their
VLOP by 1.

If the submitter of a proposal states that it is Ordinary at the time
that they submit it, and the proposal's adoption index is not greater
than the power of this rule, then the decision to adopt the proposal
is Ordinary.

The eligible voters on an ordinary decision are those entities that
were active first-class players at the start of its voting period. The
voting limit of each eligible voter on an ordinary decision is eir
VLOP, or 0 if e does not have a VLOP.}
