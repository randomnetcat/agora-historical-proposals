     When a judge judges an interested case within its time limit, e
     earns a draw from the Deck of Justice.  These Draws are tracked
     by the CotC. If a judge's judgement is OVERTURNED on appeal, one
     justice on the appeals panel CAN, in a timely fashion, destroy
     one Justice card e indicates in the judge's possession by
     announcement.

[Under the previous wording a justice on an appeals panel could
theoretically wait years, possibly until the original judge drew a
rare card, to destroy a card he earned from the original judgement.
Under this wording, he may only take that action with 7 days.]
