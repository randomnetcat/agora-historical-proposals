Amend Rule 2126 by amending the paragraph starting with (-R) to read:
      (-R) When a proposal's voting index is less than half its
           adoption index, its proposer loses one Red VC, if e has
           any.


[Prevents Party VC loss for making unpopular proposals..  Scamsters'
proposals will often have such voting indices, but scamsters are the ones
who need VCs most!  And, for that matter, legitimate radicals, or anyone
trying to modify a Power=3 rule...]
