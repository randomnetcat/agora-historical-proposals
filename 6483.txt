If any single amendment in this proposal would fail other than due to
this sentence, then this proposal as a whole except for this sentence
has no effect.


Amend Rule 2225 (Interest Index of Judicial Cases) to read as follows:
{
      Each judicial case has an interest index, which CAN be set by
      its initiator at the time of initiation, or otherwise defaults to
      zero.

      A player CAN, Without N Objections, increase or decrease the
      interest index of a judicial case by 1, where N is the 4 minus the
      interest index of that case immediately prior to that change.

      A player CAN set the interest index of a disinterested judicial
      case to 1 by announcement.

      When a player recuses emself from a judicial case whose interest
      index equals eir rank, the case's interest index is increased by 1
      unless the recusing player announces in the same message that it
      should not.
}


Amend Rule 1871 (The Standing Court) by inserting, immediately after the
paragraph reading:
{
      When the CotC assigns a player as judge, that player becomes
      sitting.
}
the paragraph:
{
      A sitting player that assigns judgement in a disinterested
      judicial case CAN and MAY become standing by announcement in the
      same message in which e assigns judgement to that case.
}

judicial question" with "assigns a judgement to a judicial question in
