Create a rule titled "Win by Junta" with Power 2 and this text:

     When a rule comes to state that one or more persons CAN cause it
     to make arbitrary rule changes by announcement, all those persons
     satisfy the Winning Condition of Dictatorship.

     Cleanup procedure:  Those persons SHALL as soon as possible amend
     the rule so that it no longer states this, and SHOULD amend the
     rules to prevent this condition from being achieved again in
     essentially the same way.

[If the triggering rule has Power >= 2, then the dictator(s) can
 effectively ignore the SHALL by creating a rule that takes precedence
 over it, but this is considered bad form.]
