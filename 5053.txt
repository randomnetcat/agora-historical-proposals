Create a rule titled "Mother, May I?" with this text:

      The following terms are defined.  These definitions are used
      when a rule includes a term in all caps, and SHOULD be used when
      a rule includes a term otherwise.  Earlier definitions take
      precedence over later ones.  If a rule specifies one or more
      players in connection with a term, then the term applies only to
      the specified player(s).

        1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID:  Attempts to
           perform the described action are unsuccessful.

        2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED:
           Performing the described action violates the rule in
           question.

        3. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED:  Before performing the
           described action, the full implications of performing it
           should be understood and carefully weighed.

        4. CAN X ONLY IF Y:  Equivalent to "CANNOT X unless Y".  Similar
           for (MUST, MAY, SHALL, SHOULD) X ONLY IF Y.

        5. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY:  Failing to perform the
           described action violates the rule in question.

        6. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Before failing to perform
           the described action, the full implications of failing to
           perform it should be understood and carefully weighed.
