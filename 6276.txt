This proposal has no effect unless "Privilege of the Champion" passed.

Goethe is a coauthor of this proposal.

Amend rule 2186 (Victory) by replacing the final paragraph with:
      A person CAN spend a Laurel to win the game.

      A player (the trumpeter) CAN act on behalf of another player (the
      reluctant victor) to cause em to spend a Laurel, provided that all
      of the following conditions are satisfied:

        The reluctant victor is not a Minister without Portfolio.

        The reluctant victor owns a Laurel.

        If the reluctant victor has ever spent or been caused to spend a
        Laurel, then e has borne the Patent Title Minister without
        Portfolio at least once since the most recent time e did so or
        was caused to do so.

      Upon the trumpeter doing so, the reluctant victor wins the game.

      A person CANNOT win the game except as specified in this rule,
      rules to the contrary notwithstanding.
