[Allows the Assessor to preemptively publish a Notice of Complacency
 for ordinary proposals that are fated to fail quorum.

 Also cleans up the definition of Sending It Back Where It Don't Belong
 a smidgeon.]

Proposal: Streamline complacency

Amend Rule 1965 by changing it to read:

      As soon as possible after an ordinary proposal fails quorum, the
      Assessor shall publish a Notice of Complacency to that effect.
      In addition, at any time during the voting period of an ordinary
      proposal for which the number of entities eligible to vote on
      the proposal is less than the quorum of the proposal, the
      Assessor may immediately publish a Notice of Complacency without
      waiting for the proposal's voting period to end.

      Upon publication by the Assessor of a Notice of Complacency for a
      proposal, the proposal is immediately aborted.  In addition, the
      copy of the proposal that is added to the proposal pool as a result
      of the abortion becomes democratic and distributable.

      Publication by the Assessor of a Notice of Complacency not strictly
      authorized or required by this rule is the Class 2 Crime of Sending
      It Back Where It Don't Belong.
