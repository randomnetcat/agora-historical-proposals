[A bonus temporary win condition that only two people should ever
be able to achieve.  Start your engines!]

Create the following rule, Sudden Death.

     The next player who wins the game by Renaissance simultaneously
     wins the game by satisfying the winning condition IN OVERTIME,
     provided no other player won the game by Renaissance in the
     same instant.

     If a player has won the game by Renaissance since the creation
     of this rule, the Herald CAN and SHALL, by announcement, cause
     this rule to cause Rule 2199 to repeal itself.

     The next player who wins the game by high score simultaneously
     wins the game by satisfying the winning condition IN OVERTIME,
     provided no other player won the game by high score in the
     same instant.

     If a player has won the game by High Score since the creation
     of this rule, the Herald CAN and SHALL, by a single announcement,
     cause this rule to cause Rules 2179, 2187, 2232, 2233, and 2234
     to repeal themselves in order.

     If none of the rules listed by rule number in the text of this
     rule exist, the Herald CAN and SHALL, by announcement, cause
     this rule to repeal itself.
