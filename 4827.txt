Proposal: What's a duckway?

[Rule 1919 allows an "impeachment" with a power-1 rather than power-2
proposal. We should call it what it is.  This cleans that up (appends
a shorter version of R1919 to the Witch hunt Rule).]

Amend Rule 1486 (Procedure for an Orderly Witch Hunt) to read:

      An active player (the Witch Hunter) may hold a referendum to
      remove an officer from office.  For this referendum:

      (a) The set of eligible voters is the set of active players
          besides the Witch Hunter and the named officer.

      (b) The adoption index is 2.

      (c) "BURN THE WITCH" is a synonym for "FOR".

      (d) "LET THE WITCH LIVE" is a synonym for "AGAINST".

      (e) "OF COURSE THE WITCH IS GUILTY, BUT I WANT TO SEE WHAT OTHER
          PEOPLE THINK" is a synonym for "PRESENT".

      If the referendum is adopted, it shall have the effect of
      removing the named player from the named office.

      A player who weighs more than a duck may be installed into an
      office as electee by the adoption of a proposal with an adoption
      index of 2 or greater.  If that office is already held by a
      player, that player is removed from the office.


Set the power of Rule 1486 to 2.

Repeal Rule 1919 (Installing Officers through Proposal).
Repeal Rule 2098 (May Day).  [Pretty useless Rule I made up.
                              Rebellion is better]
