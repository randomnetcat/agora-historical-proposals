By voting FOR this proposal you agree that an OSTRACISM is necessary
for Agora Nomic.

Create a new Rule (Power=1.5) titled "Ostracism (7/08)", with the text:
{{
      Upon the creation of this Rule, the Registrar CAN and SHALL as
      soon as possible initiate an Agoran decision to determine who
      should be ostracized.  In this decision, the valid options are
      all entities, and the eligible voters are the active players.

      When the voting period of this decision ends, if the result is
      not FAILED QUORM, the entity selected by Agora is ostracized for
      thirty days.  After that duration, this rule repeals itself.  If
      the result is FAILED QUORUM, this rule repeals itself
      immediately.
