Amend Rule 1871 (The Standing Court) by replacing all text before the
paragraph beginning "When the CotC assigns a standing player" with
this text, if "Generalize poor qualification" was adopted:

      Posture is a player switch with values Standing, Sitting, Leaning,
      and Supine (default), tracked by the Clerk of the Courts.  A
      non-standing player CAN flip eir posture to any non-standing value
      by announcement.

      A supine player is unqualified to be assigned as judge of any
      judicial case.  A sitting or leaning player is poorly qualified
      to be assigned as judge of any judicial case.

or this text, otherwise:

      Posture is a player switch with values Standing, Sitting, Leaning,
      and Supine (default), tracked by the Clerk of the Courts.  A
      non-standing player CAN flip eir posture to any non-standing value
      by announcement.

      A supine player is unqualified to be assigned as judge of any
      judicial case.  The CotC SHALL NOT assign a sitting or leaning
      player to be the judge of any judicial case.  If the CotC has
      assigned a sitting or leaning player as judge, and that player
      is still the judge of that case, the CotC CAN recuse that judge
      from that case by announcement.

[Leaning players are candidates for judicial panels, but not for
non-appeal cases, hence they are not part of the sitting-to-standing
process.]
