Amend Rule 1607 (Distribution) by replacing

      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL, as part of eir
      weekly duties:
      a) distribute no more than MI pending proposals with such that
         the sum of the Distributabilities of the distributed
         proposals is maximised, breaking ties in favour of proposals
         which were submitted first, and
      b) distribute all disinterested pending proposals.

      In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL, as part of eir
      weekly duties:
      a) distribute MI pending proposals (or all, if there are fewer than
         MI of them) such that the sum of the Distributabilities of the
         distributed proposals is maximised, and
      b) distribute all disinterested pending proposals.

[let the Promotor choose between proposals of equal distributability,
require distribution of distributability-0 proposals which I think was
an oversight]

Amend "Proposal Fees" by removing "Subsequently, it CAN be set by any
player without two objections." and appending

      A proposal with a proposal fee of 0 is disinterested; proposals
      with positive proposal fees are interested.

Amend "Distributability" by removing

      A disinterested proposal is a proposal identified as such when
      submitted. If a proposal is disinterested, this is an essential
      parameter of the decision of whether to adopt it. The remainder
      of the rules notwithstanding, the proposal fee of a
      disinterested proposal is 0 and CANNOT be set or changed to any
      other value.
