Amend Rule 2283 (Fees) by replacing the second paragraph with:

      A rule which purports to allow a person to perform an action for
      a fee thereby allows em to perform the action by announcement
      provided that:

         (a) in the announcement, e states that there is a fee for
             that action, and

         (b) the number of ergs in eir possession is greater than or
             equal to the fee.

      Upon such an announcement, a number of ergs equal to the fee is
      destroyed in eir possession.
