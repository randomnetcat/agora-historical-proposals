If there is no Rule entitled "Spending Points", then the rest of this
proposal has no effect.

Amend Rule 1607 (The Promotor) by replacing the second paragraph with:

     Priority is an undistributed proposal switch with values of the
     integers (default zero), tracked by the Promotor. A player CAN,
     as a Spending Action, increase or decrease the Priority of a
     specified proposal by one.

     The Legislative Volume is 5 when the Speed is Slow, 10 when it
     is Normal and 20 when it is Fast.

    The Promotor CAN distribute a proposal which is in the Proposal
    Pool at any time.  In a given Agoran week, the Promotor SHALL,
    as part of eir weekly duties, out of all of the proposals which
    were in the pool at the beginning of the week, distribute the X
    proposals with the greatest Priority, breaking ties in favour of
    those proposals which were submitted first, where X is the
    minimum of the Legislative Volume and the number of such
    proposals. The Promotor SHALL NOT distribute any other
    proposals.

Set the Base Cost of changing a proposal's Priority to 3.
