Create a rule "Partnerships" with Power 1 that reads:

"A non-natural person that is created by an Agreement between two or more
persons is known as a Partnership. A Partnership comes into existence with
the initiation of the Agreement that creates it, and it ceases to exist when
that Agreement is terminated. The persons who are party to the Agreement may
change during the course of that Agreement (if the Agreement allows for it)
without disrupting the existence of the Partnership as a person as long as
that Agreement remains in effect."
