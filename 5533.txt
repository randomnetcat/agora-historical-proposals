Amend Rule 101 to read:
      The rules may define persons as possessing specific rights.
      Be it hereby proclaimed that no binding agreement or
      interpretation of Agoran law may abridge, reduce, limit, or
      remove a person's defined rights. This rule takes precedence
      over any rule which would allow restrictions of a person's rights.

         i. Every player has the right to perform an action which is
            not regulated.

        ii. Every person has the right to initiate a formal process to
            resolve matters of controversy, in the reasonable
            expectation that the controversy will thereby be resolved.
            Every person has the right to cause formal reconsideration
            of any judicial determination that e should be punished.

       iii. Every person has the right to refuse to become party to
            a binding agreement.  The absence of a person's explicit,
            willful consent shall be considered a refusal.

        iv. Every person has the right to not be considered bound by
            an agreement, or an amendment to an agreement, which e has
            not had the reasonable opportunity to review.

         v. Every player has the right of participation in the fora.

        vi. Every person has the right to not be penalized more than
            once for any single action or inaction.

       vii. Every player has the right to deregister rather than
            continue to play.

      Please treat Agora right good forever.
