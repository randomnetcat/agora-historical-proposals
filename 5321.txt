[May as well propose this, otherwise someone else will]

Amend the rule titled "Marks" by replacing this text:

      and then loses the Mark.

with this text:

      and then loses the Mark; however, if e has no VCs at all, either,
      then the Mark loss is waived (you still can't get blood from a
      turnip, not even a thimbleful at a time).
