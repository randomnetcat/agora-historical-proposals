Amend Rule 106 (Adopting Proposals) by replacing this text:

      A proposal is a fixed body of text which has been made into a
      proposal using a process specifically described in the Rules.
      When creating proposals, the person who creates them SHOULD
      ensure that the proposal outlines changes to be made to Agora,
      such as enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making other
      explicit changes to the gamestate. When a proposal that includes
      such explicit changes takes effect, it applies those changes to
      the gamestate. If the proposal cannot make some such changes,
      this does not preclude the other changes from taking place.

      When a person creates a proposal, e SHOULD ensure that it
      specifies one or more changes to the gamestate.  Except as
      prohibited by other rules, a proposal that takes effect CAN,

      the proposal cannot make some such changes, this does not preclude
