Proposal:  Let's Play Q*Bert (tm)

 [Add a new Land Type.]
 Amend R1997 to read:
       In addition to Aether, the following Land Types are defined:
         (a) Black;
         (b) White;
         (c) Purple.

 [Create Q*Bert.]
 Create a new rule titled "Q*Bert (tm)" with the following text:

       Q*Bert (tm) is an entity in Arcadia.  Q*Bert moves
       one space per week, according to the following procedure:

       Q*Bert moves one space in a random direction, but
       not to the space it last moved from.  Q*Bert is permitted to
       move to an undefined destination or to Aether.  If Q*Bert
       moves to an undefined destination, its location becomes
       undefined, and the next week it will move to (0,0).

       Normally, Q*Bert moves in a diagonal direction.  If Q*Bert
       ends its diagonal movement at a location that another
       entity ends eir movement at for that week, then in the
       following week Q*Bert will say "@!#?@!" and move in a
       random orthogonal direction.

       Q*Bert has a color, which is a defined Land Type other than Aether
       and that does not have Sente.  When Q*Bert moves to a space, it
       changes the Land Type of that space.  If the current Type is not
       the same as Q*Bert's color, Q*Bert changes that space's type to
       its color.  Otherwise, Q*Bert changes that space's type to the
       Land Type that currently has Sente.

       The Mapkeepor is a Limited Executor of Q*Bert, and its Prime
       Executor for its movement in Arcadia.  The Mapkeepor is to
       make the random determination of Q*Bert's movement direction
       and publish Q*Bert's movement and its effect as soon as possible
       after the start of the Agoran week.

       Upon the Mapkeepor's report that Q*Bert's color has Sente,
       Q*Bert's color becomes a random Land Type other than Aether or
       the old color.  The Mapkeepor will make this random determination.

 [Initialize values]
 Set Q*Bert's location to (0,0).
 Set Q*Bert's color to Purple.
