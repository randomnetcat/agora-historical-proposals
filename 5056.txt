Title: Disinterested Proposals

[This was our old solution to racking up bonuses for otherwise
uncontroversial fix proposals.]

Create a rule titled "Disinterested Proposals" with this text:

      A proposal is disinterested if it is labeled as such by its
      author at the time of submission.  A proposal should be
      disinterested if and only if its effects are limited to
      correcting errors and/or ambiguities.

      The author and co-author(s) of a disinterested proposal
      do not receive any rewards for its adoption, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

Amend Rule 2126 (Voting Credits) by replacing "When an Ordinary proposal
is adopted" with "When an Ordinary Interested proposal is adopted".
