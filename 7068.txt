Enact a new Power 2 Rule entitled "Spending Points":

     Where the Rules state that a player CAN perform an action 'as a
     Spending Action', this means that the player CAN perform this
     action by destroying a number of Points in eir possession equal
     to the cost of that action, provided they have enough Points. If
     a player CAN perform an action by spending 0 points, e CAN
     perform it by announcement.

     Each spending action has a base cost, which is a non-negative
     integer defaulting to five. The base cost of each spending
     action is tracked by the Scorekeepor, and players CAN change it
     without two objections. The cost of a spending action is
     generally its base cost, subject to modification by other Rules.
