Create the rule 'Motions to Reconsider' at power 1.7 and with the
following text:

     If a non-Appeals judicial question (1) has a judgement that has been
     in effect for less than seven days and not been appealed, and (2) has
     not had a Motion to Reconsider filed for it at any time while it has
     been assigned to its current judge, then any Player CAN file a Motion
     to Reconsider the question with 2 Support.

     When a Motion to Reconsider is so filed, the question is rendered
     open again.  A player who files such a Motion SHOULD include
     arguments as to why the question needs reconsideration, and such
     arguments become part of the record of the case.
