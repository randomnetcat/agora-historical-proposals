Amend rule 2201 by replacing:
{{
      b) A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact.  The
         publisher of the original document SHALL respond to a claim
         of error as soon as possible, either publishing a revision or
         denying the claim.  If e denies the claim, then the original
         document is ratified one week after the denial, unless it is
         challenged again (subject to the same requirements) during
         that period.

with
{{
      b) A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact.  The
         publisher of the original document SHALL respond to a claim
         of error as soon as possible, either publishing a revision or
         denying the claim. Until e does so, the claim is outstanding.
         After a claim is denied, the original document is ratified one
         week after the denial, unless it is challenged again (subject
         to the same requirements) during that period, there is an
         outstanding claim at the time of the denial, or the officer has
         published a revision to the document as required by this rule.
