Create a rule titled 'Lack of Interest' with the following text:

      Any player may make a proposal disinterested during its
      voting period With 2 Supporters.

[[[
  I don't think it should just be left up to the proposer to decide
  whether their proposal should receive a VC award. Of course, the
  proposal in question could just be voted against, but for minor
  error corrections going through a resubmission process seems a bit
  over the top.

  (I think the dis/interested system has been used in the spirit it
   was intended so far. This is just intended prevent issues)
