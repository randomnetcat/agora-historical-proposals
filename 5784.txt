Adoption index: 1.0

Amend rule 2136 (Contests) by replacing the text:

      Any player CAN flip the contestmaster of a public contract
      without 3 objections, except if doing so would cause a player to
      be contestmaster of more than one contest, or it would flip the
      contestmaster of a contract to a player who has not explicitly
      consented to be contestmaster of that contest.  (If a player
      intends to flip the contestmaster of a contract to emself, this
      is considered explicit consent to be contestmaster of that
      contract.)

with:

      The contestmaster of a contract CANNOT be flipped if any of the
      following are true:

        a) The contract is private.

        b) Doing so would cause a player to be contestmaster of more
           than one contest.

        c) Doing so would flip the contestmaster of a contract to a
           player who has not explicitly consented to be contestmaster
           of that contest.  (If a player intends to flip the
           contestmaster of a contract to emself, this is considered
           explicit consent to be contestmaster of that contract.)

      Otherwise, the contestmaster of a contract CAN be flipped

        a) by any player without 3 objections, or

        b) if the contract is a contest, by any mechanism specified by
          that contract for flipping its contestmaster.
