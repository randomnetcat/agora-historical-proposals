Amend Rule 1504 (Criminal Cases) by replacing the descriptions of
UNIMPUGNED and INNOCENT with this text:

     * INNOCENT, appropriate if the defendant did not violate the
       specified rule by performing the alleged act

[Combines INNOCENT ("I didn't do it") and UNIMPUGNED ("it's not
against the law"), which have been confused more than once.]
