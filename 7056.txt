If there exists a rule entitled Speed, append to it this paragraph:

{ For all x, y and z, the notation "(x;y;z)" means "x (if the Speed is
Slow), y (if the Speed is Normal), or z (if the Speed is Fast)". }

If Rule 2143 (Official Reports and Duties) contains the string "the
holder of that office SHALL perform it at least once each week, except
if the Speed is Slow, in which case the duties SHALL be completed once
each fortnight.", replace it with "the holder of that office SHALL
perform it at least one each (fortnight;week;week)."

If Rule 1023 (Common Definitions) contains the string { "within X
days", where X is 14 when the Speed is Slow, 7 when it is Normal and 5
when it is Fast. }, replace it with { "within (14;7;5) days". }.
