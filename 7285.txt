If Rule 2162 (Switches) contains a paragraph reading, in its entirety:

      c) Optionally, exactly one office whose holder tracks instances
         of that switch.  That officer's report includes the value of
         each instance of that switch whose value is not its default
         value.

append to it:

      (If such an office's weekly report is empty, and has not only
      recently become that way, that officer is ENCOURAGED not to send
      public messages merely stating the fact.)
