Amend Rule 591 (Inquiry Cases) by replacing this text:

       * UNDETERMINED, appropriate if the statement is nonsensical or
         too vague, or if the information available to the judge is
         insufficient to determine which of the FALSE, TRUE, and
         UNDECIDABLE judgements is appropriate; however, uncertainty as
         to how to interpret or apply the rules cannot constitute
         insufficiency of information for this purpose

with this text:

         determine which of the FALSE, TRUE, and UNDECIDABLE judgements
         is appropriate; however, uncertainty as to how to interpret or

         for this purpose
