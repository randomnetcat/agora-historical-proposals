Amend rule 2161 by replacing "SHALL assign an ID number to it by
announcement" with "CAN assign an ID number to it by announcement, and
SHALL do so", and replacing "cannot be changed" with "CANNOT be
changed", and replacing "officer's report SHALL include" with
"officer's report includes", and appending to the list the item

      (f) ID numbers CANNOT be assigned to that type of entity except
          as specified by this rule.

[Make possibility explicit throughout, in MMI terms.  Also a fix for
the officer's report, to match the semantics used elsewhere in the
ruleset.]
