Proposal:  Remove Some Cards

Amend the Onepower Cardbook as follows:

   Change the Limited Exploit to read:
      * Limited [X a type of entity] [Y a positive integer]: If you
        are not an X, treat this card as if it were Costly[Y].

   Change the Costly Exploit to read:
      * Costly [ Y a positive integer]: You must discard Y cards to
        play this card.  For each of these discards, you
        may substitute one of your existing pending draws which
        is then considered satisfied.

   Remove the descriptions of the following cards:
     Not Your Turn
     Two for One
     Chaos Reborn
     Greedy Bastard
     Charity Brings Happiness
     Thieves in the Night
     Instant Gratification
     Instant Punishment
     Instant Millionaire
