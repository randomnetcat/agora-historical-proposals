Proposal
Fix Submitting CFJs to the Justiciar v2
AI = 2, Please

Make Rule 2023 be a Power 2 Rule.

Amend Rule 2023 to read as follows:

      A CFJ may be submitted to the Justiciar.  For such a CFJ, the
      Justiciar shall perform all duties and fulfill all roles that would
      otherwise be assigned to the Clerk of the Courts. This takes
      precedence over Rules that would otherwise assign duties and roles
      regarding a CFJ to the Clerk of the Courts.

      All persons are encouraged to submit a CFJ to the Justiciar only
      when there is a good reason not to submit it to the Clerk of the
      Courts.
