Change the title of Rule 2352 to "Foreign Relations", and amend it to
read:

       The Ambassador is an office; its holder is responsible for
       managing the affairs of state of Agora.

       Any player CAN (with Agoran Consent, or without 3 objections if e
       is the Ambassador) authorize emself to perform a specified action
       on Agora's behalf in another nomic.  Acting on Agora's behalf in
       another nomic is effective only if:

         a) The actor authorized emself to perform that action on Agora's
            behalf (as described above) no more than one week earlier.

         b) The actor clearly indicates to that nomic that e is acting
            on Agora's behalf, and clearly identifies the Ambassador (or
            that it is vacant) to the best of eir knowledge.

         c) That nomic's rules acknowledge that Agora is a person, and
            that the actor is acting on Agora's behalf.

       Upon an ineffective claim to act on Agora's behalf in another
       nomic, the Ambassador SHALL inform that nomic of the situation
       as soon as possible.

       A player SHALL NOT make an ineffective claim to act on Agora's
       behalf in another nomic.  Doing so is the Class-7 Crime of
       Inciting Foreign Aggression.
