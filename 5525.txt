Amend Rule 2187 (Win by High Score) by replacing this text:

      Cleanup procedure:  Each player's score is set to 0.

with this text:

      Cleanup procedure:  All those players have eir scores set
      to 0.  All other players have eir scores set to floor(N*S/10),
      where N is eir previous score and S is the Score Index.

      The Score Index is an integer from 0 to 5, and part of the
      Scorekeepor's report.  The Scorekeepor CAN change the Score
      Index without objection.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, the Score Index is set to 0.
